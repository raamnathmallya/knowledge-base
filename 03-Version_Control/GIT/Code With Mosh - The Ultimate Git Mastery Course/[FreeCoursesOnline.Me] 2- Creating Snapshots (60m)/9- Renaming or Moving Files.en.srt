1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,080
Now let's talk about renaming or
moving files. So currently we

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,690
have a single file in our
working directory, and that is

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,680
file one dot txt. Let's rename
this to main dot j s. So we use

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,520
the Move command in Unix to
rename file one dot txt to main

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,720
j s. So in this command, we can
rename or move files and

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,650
directories. Okay, now, our
working directory is dirty. So

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,270
let's run git status. We have
two changes, and both these

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,020
changes are unstaged because
they're indicated by red, we

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,680
have a delete operation with
deleted file on the txt. And

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,250
under untracked files, we have a
new file. So as you saw at the

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,340
beginning of this section, git
doesn't automatically track all

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,130
your new files. Every time you
have a new file in your project,

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,710
you have to add it to the
staging area, so Git starts

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,950
tracking it. So once again, we
have to use the Add command to

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,200
stage both these changes. git
add file one dot txt This is for

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,820
staging the delicia Now let's
add the new untracked file, main

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,590
dot j s. Now, let's run git
status one more time, look, give

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,370
recognize that we've renamed
file one dot txt to main j s.

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,700
And this item is indicated by
green, which means this is in

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,360
the staging area. So renaming or
moving files is a two step

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,480
operation. First, we have to
modify our working directory.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,870
And then we have to stage two
types of changes, and addition

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,890
and deletion. So similar to
removing files, get gives us a

24
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,480
special command for renaming or
moving files. That is good move.

25
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,990
So instead of using the standard
move command in Unix, we're

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,940
going to use Git more. Now let's
rename main j, s, to file on the

27
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,620
J s, and then run git status one
more time. So we have a rename

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,540
operation for renaming file on a
txt the file on the J s. So when

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,600
we use the Move command, the
changes are applied to both the

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,590
working directory and the
staging area. Now let's commit

31
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,020
the changes For the message, I'm
going to say refactor code. The

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,500
look at the statistics, one file
was changed. We have zero

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,010
insertions because we haven't
added any new lines to any of

34
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,160
our files. And we also have zero
deletions because we haven't

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,900
removed any lines from any
files.
