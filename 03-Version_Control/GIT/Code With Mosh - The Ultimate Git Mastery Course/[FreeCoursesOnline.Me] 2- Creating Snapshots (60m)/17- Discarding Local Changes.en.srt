1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,819
There are times that we have
some code in our working

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,639
directory that we want to throw
away. Let's say we made some

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,129
changes, but we didn't like
those changes. So we want to

4
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:14,339
scratch everything and start
over, we can discard the local

5
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,309
changes using the Restore
command. So here we have some

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,599
local changes in file one dot j,
s. To undo this changes, we type

7
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,369
Git restore, file one dot j s,
when we execute this command,

8
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:29,159
Git is going to take the version
of this file in the next

9
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,679
environment, which is our
staging environment, it's going

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,159
to take that version and copy
into our working directory. We

11
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,399
can also use a period here, and
this will undo all the local

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,059
changes. Now let me show you
something. So the command is

13
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,529
executed. Now let's run another
short status. But file two is

14
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:50,609
still here. Why is that? Well,
this is a new untracked file. So

15
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,759
Git hasn't been tracking this.
So when we tell Git to reassert

16
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,209
this file, git doesn't know
where to get a previous version

17
00:00:57,209 --> 00:01:00,119
of his file. It doesn't exist in
our staging environment or In

18
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,809
our repository, so, to remove
all these new untracked files,

19
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,909
we have to type git clean. Take
a look. By default, we get this

20
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,709
fatal error saying required for
us to false to true. And neither

21
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,399
of these searches are given. So
basically git us telling us that

22
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:20,249
hey, this is a dangerous
operation. If you accidentally

23
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:23,189
remove this on track files,
there is no way you can recover

24
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,779
them. So let's try and git clean
dash H for a quick help. Here we

25
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:31,409
have this option dash F, which
forces git to remove this on

26
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,059
track fast. You also have dash D
for removing whole directories.

27
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,359
So quite often we type Git clean
dash fd. Now, let's run short

28
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,319
status again. File two is gone.
So this is how we undo local

29
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,859
changes.
