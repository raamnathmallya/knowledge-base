1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,060
Let's say that we just
discovered that we no longer

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,240
need file to in our project
because it contains unused code.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,580
So to remove this file, we type
RM file to the txt. Again, this

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,340
is not a good command because it
doesn't start with Git. It's

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,960
just a standard Unix command.
Okay, so let's go with this. Now

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,060
we have a yellow indicator,
which means our working

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,830
directory is dirty. So let's run
git status. We have one change

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,300
that is not staged for commit.
So we remove file two from our

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,020
working directory, but still
exists in the staging area. Let

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,300
me prove it to you. So we type
git, LS dash files. These are

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,810
the files in our staging area.
So file two still here, even

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,480
though we removed it from our
working directory. So as I told

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,630
you before, every time we make
changes, we have to stage those

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,850
changes using the Add command.
So here we type git add file to

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,000
the txt to stage this change or
this deletion more, actually

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,030
accurately. Now let's run git LS
slash files one more time. So

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,450
file two is no longer in the
staging area. Beautiful. Let's

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,890
run git status, we have one
change that is ready to be

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,070
committed. And as you can see,
it's indicated by green, which

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,560
means it's in the staging area.
So let's commit this change. And

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,930
here we're going to say, remove
unused code. So to remove a

22
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,170
file, we have to remove it from
both our working directory as

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,020
well as the staging area.
Because this is a very common

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,840
operation, git gives us a
command that does both of these

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,880
steps in one go. Let me show
you. So we type Git RM. So

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,990
instead of using the standard rm
command in Unix, we use Git Rm

27
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,830
karolis, the file name, like
file two dot txt, we can also

28
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,000
specify multiple files. We can
also use patterns like all text

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,240
files. When we execute this
command, git remote this file

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,390
from both the working directory
as well as the staging area.
