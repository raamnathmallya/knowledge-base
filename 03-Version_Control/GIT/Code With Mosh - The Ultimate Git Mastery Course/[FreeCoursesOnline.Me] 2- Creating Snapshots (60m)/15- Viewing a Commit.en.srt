1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,750
So viewing the list of commits
is great. But what if we want to

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,930
see what exactly we have changed
in a given commit, that's when

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,690
we use the show command. For
example, let's say we want to

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,200
look at the content of this
commit over here, we type Git

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,050
show. Now here, we need to
specify the commit, we want to

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,050
inspect, there are two ways to
reference a commit, we can

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,520
reference it using its unique
identifier. So we type d, 601,

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,360
B, 9 0. Now we don't have to
type all the seven characters,

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,690
we can type fewer characters, as
long as we don't have another

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,020
commit, whose ID starts with
these characters. So that's one

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,570
way to reference a commit. And
another way is to use the head

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,870
pointer. So look, head is
currently in front of the last

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,800
commit. So to view the last
commit, we can type head or to

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,370
look at previous commit, we can
type a till there, and then

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,790
specify how many steps we want
to go back. So if we type one,

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,330
we start from head which is
here, we go one step back, and

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,160
this References This comment
over here. Let's take a look. So

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,770
on the top, we can see the
author and the date of this

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,280
commit, as well as its message.
Below that we have a diff of

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,650
what has changed. So in this
commit, we have changed a single

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,150
file that is git ignore. Over
here, we can see that we removed

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,780
this line and added these two
lines. So this is very useful.

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,810
Now what if we don't want to see
the differences, we want to see

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,690
the final version, the exact
version that is stored in this

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,190
commit? Well, you bring up the
last command, get show head till

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,150
the one. Then we type a colon.
And here we specified the full

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,830
path to a file. For example, we
can say, dot Git ignore or if

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,150
this file is in a subdirectory.
We type for example, bin slash

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,030
app dot bin Okay, now let's look
at Git ignore. So this is the

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,150
exact version stored in this
commit. Now, earlier I told you

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,570
that each commit contains a
complete snapshot of our working

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,760
directory, not just changes, but
when we run the show command. We

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,760
only see the differences? What
is changed? What if you want to

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
see all the files and
directories in a commit? Well,

35
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,730
for that, we're gonna use a
different command. That's called

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,710
LS tree. Now why is this called
a tree, well, it tree is a data

37
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,770
structure for representing
hierarchical information. So in

38
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,560
a tree, we can have nodes, and
these nodes can have children.

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,040
Now directory on the file system
can be represented using a tree.

40
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,310
Because each directory can have
children, these children can be

41
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,740
files, and other sub
directories. If you want to

42
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,050
learn more about this concept,
you should take my dat

43
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,980
structures course. So LS tree m
ans list all the files in a t

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,910
ee. Now here we specified the c
mments we're interested in had t

45
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,780
lde one. And now look, these a
e all the files and d

46
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,200
rectories stored in this c
mmit. So we have Git ignore. R

47
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,140
ght before that we have a u
ique identifier that is g

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,650
nerated based on the content o
this file. So in gits d

49
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,460
tabase. We have an object with t
is ID. Below that we have b

50
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,790
en, again, it has a unique i
entifier that is generated b

51
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,910
sed on the content of this d
rectory, now look at the type o

52
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,660
this object, it's a tree. So f
les are represented using b

53
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,170
obs, and directories are r
presented using trees. All of t

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,410
ese are objects that are s
ored in gits database. Using t

55
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,930
e show command, we can easily v
ew an object and gits d

56
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,890
tabase. For example, if we t
pe Git show, and then specify t

57
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,770
is unique identifier, or we c
n type only the few c

58
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,390
aracters, as long as there is n
ambiguity. So here's the c

59
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,490
ntent of our Git ignore file. A
another example, let's look a

60
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,050
this object, this tree, the b
n directory, so git show 6

61
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,690
629. Here we have a tree. In t
is tree, we have this file, a

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,800
p dot bin. So using the show co
mand, we can view an object an

63
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,820
gets database. These objects ca
be commits, blobs, which re

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,270
resent files, and trees which re
resent directories, as well as

65
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,460
tags. We'll talk about tags in
the future.
