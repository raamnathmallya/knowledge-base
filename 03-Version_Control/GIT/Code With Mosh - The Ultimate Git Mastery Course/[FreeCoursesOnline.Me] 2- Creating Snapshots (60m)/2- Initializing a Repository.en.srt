1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,479
The first thing we're going to
do is create a directory for our

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:09,269
project. You can call this
directory anything and put it

3
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:12,539
anywhere on your machine, it
doesn't matter. I'm currently in

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,439
the projects directory. So let's
create a directory called moon,

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,399
and then go into this directory.
So let's imagine this is our

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,609
project directory. and here we
can have 10s, or hundreds of

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,059
files.

8
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:26,849
The first time we want to add
this file to a git repository,

9
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:27,359
we have

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,860
to initialize a new empty
repository. So we type Git in

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,280
it, look at this message,
initialized, empty Git

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,790
repository in and here's the
full path. So we have the moon

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,310
directory. And inside this
directory, we have a

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,910
subdirectory called dot Git.
And, by default, this

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,490
subdirectory is hidden because
you're not supposed to touch it.

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,040
So if we type ls to list all the
files and directories here, we

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,850
don't see anything. But if you
type ls dash A, which is short

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,200
for all, we can see the Git sub
directory If you're on Mac, you

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,260
can open this with Finder. And
if you're on Windows, you can

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,590
open it with Windows Explorer or
File Explorer. I'm not sure why

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,900
it's called these days. So let's
open .git take a look.

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,450
So here's our Git directory or
Git repository. This is where

23
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,630
Git stores information about our
project history. So we have

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,710
directories like branches,
hooks, info, objects, and

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,830
references. Now someone using
Git, you don't really need to

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,040
understand this structure. This
is purely implementation detail.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,100
It's how Git stores information.
It's none of our business.

28
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,430
That's why this directory is
hidden so you don't touch it. If

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,710
you corrupt or remove this
directory, you're gonna lose

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,710
your project history. Let me
show you. So back in the

31
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,670
terminal, look at this green
marker. It says Git that means

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,550
we have a git repository in this
directory. Now if you want to

33
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,820
have a pretty colorful terminal
window like this on mac you need

34
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,390
to install zelis H or z shell
and on Windows, you need to

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,260
install poshkit but don't worry
about it. Now, these tools are

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,170
completely optional to use. Git
is just for making things

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,560
pretty. So here we have a git
repository. Now, if I remove the

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,180
Git subdirectory, we're going to
lose this repository. So RM dash

39
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,460
RF .Git, look, the green mar
er is gone. We don't have a git

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,180
repository here anymore. So don
t touch this directory. Now once

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,130
again, let's initialize a Git
repository. Beautiful. So now

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,830
that we have a repository. Next
we're going to talk about the

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,150
basic Git workflow.
