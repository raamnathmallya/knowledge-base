1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,140
So now you know that once Git
tracks a file, it stores every

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,080
version of that file in its
database. And that means if you

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,380
screw things, we can always
restore a file or a directory to

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,320
a previous version. So in this
demo, I'm going to delete a file

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,130
and then show you how to restore
it. It's very easy. So we're

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,430
going to delete file one dot J
s, I told you that if we use the

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,790
rm command in Linux, or Unix
based systems, this will only

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,520
remove the file from the working
directory. So then we'll have to

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,670
state the change or the
deletion. A better way is to use

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,050
the Git rm command. This will
remove the file from both the

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,220
working directory as well as the
staging area. Okay. Now let's

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,270
get a short status. So in the
staging area, we have a deleted

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,370
file. Now, let's make a commit,
delete file one dot J s.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,240
Alright, now let's say shoot, we
shouldn't have deleted this

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,630
file. So what can we do here?
Well, we have a few options. We

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,390
can undo or revert the last
commit. We're going to talk

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,940
about that later in the course.
But in this lesson, I want to

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,600
talk about restoring a file to a
previous version, not undoing a

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,240
commit. So let's look at our
history. Alright, so here's our

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,080
history, we want to restore file
one to the commit before the

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,030
last commit, that is coming over
here. So we type Git restore.

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,740
Now let's have a quick look at
the documentation. The restore

23
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,980
command takes three types of
arguments, we can supply a bunch

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,280
of options, we can supply a
source, you haven't done this so

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,420
far. So by default, git will
restore that file from the next

26
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,450
environment or the next area. So
if the file we want to restore

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,120
is in the working directory gets
we'll restore it from the

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,180
staging area. And if the file is
in the staging area, it will

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,450
restore it from the last
snapshot or the last commit. Now

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,120
in this case, we want to change
the default behavior. We want to

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,650
restore a file from the commit
before the last one. So we type

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,740
git restore data source, we set
it to head tilda one. And then

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,280
we specify the full path to the
file. In this case, file one dot

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,110
j s. Now, let's get a short
status. So we have a new

35
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,500
untracked file. So this is how
we can restore a file to a

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,340
previous version.
