1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,930
We've made a few commits so far.
But where are these commits? Let

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,200
me show you. So we use the lock
command to look at our history.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,250
Take a look. So here are all the
commits we have created, sorted

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,190
from the latest to the earliest.
So here's our last commit on

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,060
top. Each commit has a unique
identifier. This is a 40

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,210
character, hexadecimal string
that gets automatically

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,060
generates for us. You can think
of it like a revision number,

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,240
but unlike a revision number, it
doesn't increase. It's just a

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,930
unique identifier. Okay. Now
next to that we have head

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,080
pointing to master. What is
this? Well, we're going to talk

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,710
about this a lot in the future.
But Master is the main branch or

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,800
the main line of working get in
some other version control

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,590
systems. It's called trunk and
get we can have multiple

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,980
branches. So we can work on
multiple features or multiple

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,250
bug fixes in parallel, and then
combine our code. We'll talk

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
about that later in the course.
Now head is a reference to the

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,750
current branch. So this is how
Git knows one branch we're

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,300
currently working on. Again,
we're going to talk about this a

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,780
lot in the future. Now for each
commit, you can see the author,

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,710
the name of the author, as well
as their email, the date and

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,710
time the commit was created, as
well as the one line

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,160
description. Like here, we have
multiple commits that are spread

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,030
across multiple pages, we can
press space to go to the next

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,250
page. And again, now to quit, we
can press Q. Now the lock

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,940
command has a few interesting
options. One of them is one

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,350
line. This shows us a short
summary of the commands. So here

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,690
we have the unique identifier
that is shortened to seven

28
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,830
characters, and we only have the
one line description, so we

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,620
don't have the author as well as
the date and time of each

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,040
commit. We have another option
for reversing the sort order.

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,110
Let me show you. So git log one
line, and then we add dash dash,

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,370
reverse. Now we can see the
first command be on top and

33
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,820
here's the last command. Now the
lock command is very powerful.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So in the future, we're going to
talk a lot about it. In fact, we

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,850
have a complete section on
browsing history. I'm going to

36
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,940
show you various ways to get
reports from the history. For

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,470
now, let's just stick to the
basics.
