00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,960
One of the common questions a
lot of beginners have is, do we

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,290
always have to state our changes
before committing them? Well,

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,960
the answer is no. And in this
video, I'm going to show you how

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,110
to skip the staging area. But do
this only if you know what

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,650
you're doing. If you're 100%
sure that your code your changes

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,900
don't need to be reviewed,
because that's the whole point

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,710
of having a staging area. So
let's modify find one and then

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,600
committed in one step. We're
going to say echo test to file

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,190
one dot txt. Once again, we're
appending this line to file one

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,270
dot txt, okay. All right. Now
that we have a yellow indicator,

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,050
because our working directory is
dirty, so instead of running git

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,960
add, and then committing an in
two steps, we're going to

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,680
commit. Here we're going to
supply the option dash a which

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,060
means all that means all modify
files, and then just like before

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,520
we supply a message, or we can
combine these two options. So a

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,280
supplier to fix the bug that
prevented the users from signing

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,500
up. Let's go. Our code is
committed. One file was changed,

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,770
and we have one insertion. So
this is how we can skip the

19
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,980
staging area. But once again, do
this only if you know what

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,100
you're doing 99% of the time,
you should always state your

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,350
code before committing into the
repository.
