1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,660
Now we have a snapshot in the
staging area ready to be

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,960
permanently stored in our
repository. So we type git

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,270
commit, dash M for message. And
here in double quotes, we type a

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,360
short description that
identifies what this snapshot

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,950
represents. So here I'm going to
say, initial commit. Now there

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,830
are times that a short one line
description is not sufficient.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,550
You want to explain some details
to give context. For example, if

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,640
you worked on a bug, and there
were some constraints at the

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
time you committed your code,
you want to explain those

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,040
constraints. This is very
valuable to both you and your

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,600
coworkers. So in situations like
this, we drop the message. We

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,730
just type git commit. Now when
we press enter, this opens our

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,210
default editor, in this case VS
code, because at the beginning

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,390
of the course, I configured my
default editor to be VS code.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,080
Okay. So here we're trying to
edit this file, commit,

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,310
underlined edit message which
stored in our Git subdirectory.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,890
So, on the top, we can type a
short description. Ideally,

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,770
there should be less than 80
characters, and then we add a

19
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,360
line break. And after that we
can type a long description. Now

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,240
this lines that start with a
pound sign or comments, they're

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,660
gonna get ignored. So we typed
what everyone here in this case,

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,210
I'm going to say, initial
command. And this is our first

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,760
commit. Of course, this is
repetitive. We don't have commit

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,490
messages like this. But for this
demo, I'm going to go with this

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,680
message. So we save the changes.
Then, we close this window. Back

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,770
in the terminal, our snapshot is
committed. And here we have

27
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,190
basic statistics about what was
changed. So two files were

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,940
changed which are file one and
file two. And we have three

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,480
insertions, three lines were
inserted. In file one, we

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,440
inserted two lines, hello world,
and in file, two inserted one

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,320
line. Now look at this
indicator, it turned green,

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,740
because our working directory is
Now clean, it doesn't have any

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,310
new changes. So what we have in
our working directory is exactly

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,700
the same content we have in our
staging area, which is exactly

35
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,920
the same content we have in the
last commit.
