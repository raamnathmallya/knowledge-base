00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,380
The first thing you need to know
to use Git effectively is how to

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,840
take snapshots of your project,
which is what we're going to

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,360
talk about. In this section,
we'll be talking about the

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,470
fundamental concepts of Git that
are often misunderstood. So make

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,110
sure to watch every lesson in
this section. Even if you think

00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,020

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,590
in this section. Now let's jump
in and get started.
