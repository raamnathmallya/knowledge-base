1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,360
Now let's look at the git tools
built into VS code.

2
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,079
So here on the left side, we
have the source control panel

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:13,739
where we can see all the changes
in our project. So what we see

4
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:17,489
here is similar to the output of
the status command, we can see

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,309
all the change files, and the
kind of changes introduced in

6
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,449
those files. So here we have
changes in file, one dot j s, we

7
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,989
can click on a file to get a
diff of that file. Now here we

8
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,959
are dealing with a new untracked
file as you can see up here,

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,739
that's why we don't have any
code on the left side. Now we

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,959
can stage this file by clicking
on the plus icon. If we made a

11
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:43,529
mistake, we can always on stage
a file that's very easy. All we

12
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:48,149
have to do is to click on the
minus icon. Now we have local

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,329
changes in our working
directory. So let's go ahead and

14
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,289
stage this file one more time.
Let's say we have reviewed our

15
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,949
changes and we want to proceed
to make a commit. Up here we can

16
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,369
type a commit message. So for
this demo, we can say, add,

17
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:05,819
file, one dot j s, just
remember, this is not a good

18
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,699
commit message, because our
commits should be based on

19
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:12,029
logical units of work, not
individual files added or

20
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:17,729
removed. Okay, so let's go ahead
and make a commit. Good. Now,

21
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,869
back to the Explorer panel. We
have a fairly new feature here.

22
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,869
I think they introduced it a
couple of months ago. If we

23
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,089
click on a file, and then open
the timeline folder, we can see

24
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,869
all the commits apply to this
file. So here's our latest

25
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,049
commit. At file one, we can
click on that commit to see the

26
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,739
changes introducing that commit.
Here's the previous commit

27
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,609
delete file one dot js. We also
had another commit earlier,

28
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:48,749
refactor code is pretty helpful.
Here by default, we don't have a

29
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,839
way to look at our history. We
need to install a plugin to do

30
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:54,029
that. I'm going to talk about
that in the next section.
