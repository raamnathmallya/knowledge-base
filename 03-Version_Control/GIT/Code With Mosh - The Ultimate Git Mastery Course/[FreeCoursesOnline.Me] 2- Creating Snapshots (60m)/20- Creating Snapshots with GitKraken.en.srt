1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,410
Now let's look at the git tools
built in to GitKracken. So here

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,740
on the homepage of GitKracken,
we go to open a repository.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,700
Here, we can open an existing
repository. We can also clone a

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,250
repository. I'm going to talk
about that in the future. But

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,130
this is basically useful when we
have a repository somewhere

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,830
else. Let's see on GitHub, and
you want to take a copy of the

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,470
repository and put it on our
machine. Again, we're going to

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,590
talk about this in the future.
We can also initialize a new

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,770
repository. For this demo, I'm
going to open our moon

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,680
repository. So open repository,
go to our folder, and then open,

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,910
good. So over here we can see
all the commits we have created

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,780
so far, we can see the author of
each commit, the commit message,

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,410
and the date and time when the
commit was created. Now we can

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,070
click on each commit to see more
details. So for this commit, we

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,060
can see the commit ID. Here's
the commit message, the author,

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,440
date and time and the summary of
changes. So in this commit, we

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,950
added one new file, which is
file one dot j s. Here we have

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,910
multiple views, we have the list
view and tree view. If you have

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,550
changed multiple files in
different folders, tree view is

20
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,900
very helpful. We can also select
View All files, to see all the

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,560
files in our project. At this
point in time, if you uncheck

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,470
this, we only see the change
bias. And by change, I'm talking

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,340
about additions, modifications
and deletions. Now we can click

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,210
on each file to get a diff of
that file. So once again, we're

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,400
dealing with a new file here.
That's why we don't have any

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,170
code on the left side. Here we
have two tabs, the feel and file

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,860
view. If we switch to file view,
we can see the snapshot of this

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,940
file in this commit at this
point in time. Now, let's go

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,060
back to diff view. We also have
different ways of comparing the

30
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,150
changes. So currently, we're
looking at the split view, which

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,050
gives us the before and after
code. We also have a line view,

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,320
which is exactly like what we
get on the terminal. We also

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,040
have hunk view If you're dealing
with a large file with a bunch

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,340
of changes in different parts of
this file hunk view is an easy

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,460
way to see the changes in
ach section. Now let's make a

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,120
new commit. So we have to go bac
to VS code or our favorite ed

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,510
tor to make the changes. Because
GitKracken is just a GUI too

38
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,170
. It's not a code editor. So I
m going to go back to VS cod

39
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,770
, open file one dotJ s and write
a new line of code here, save t

40
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,090
e changes. Now, back in
GitKracken let's close thi

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,570
window. Over here, you can se
we have one change in ou

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,230
working directory. We can clic
on this button to view th

43
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,250
changes. So file one dot js i
changed. And currently it'

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,910
unstaged. We can click on thi
file to see a summary of th

45
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,790
changes. So this is the new lin
that we have introduced

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,850
Beautiful. Now we can go ove
here and stage this file o

47
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,830
stage all changes. Now this fil
isn't a staging area. If we mad

48
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,880
a mistake, we can always ask O
stage this file, super easy. So

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,830
let's save the file and the
type a commit message, let's sa

50
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,110
refactor code. And now let'
make a new commit. It's a

51
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,290
simple as that. So this is ho
we can use GitKracken to create

52
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,410
snapshots of our project, but
there is a lot more to Git

53
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,690
racken and we're going to c
ver that in the future s

54
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,290
ctions.
