1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,870
So you'll learn how to get the
status of the working directory

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,110
and the staging area using the
status command. The output of

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,210
this command is very
comprehensive, but it's also

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,180
very wordy. So as an
alternative, we can supply the

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,750
short status flag or dash s. Let
me walk you through a few

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,440
examples. So for this demo,
we're going to modify one of our

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,350
existing files, and then add a
new file. So Eiko sky, to file

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,780
one dot j, s, so we're appending
a sky to file on the J s. Now

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,340
let's create a new file. So once
again, Aiko sky to file to the J

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,410
s. Now let's run git status. We
have modified five one, and we

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,010
have a new untracked file. So as
you can see, the output of this

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,580
command is very comprehensive,
but also very wordy. Now, let's

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,170
run git status dash s. This is
much easier to dies. So let me

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,050
show you how this works. Here we
have two columns. The left

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,230
column represents the staging
area The right column represents

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,130
the working directory. So we
have modified file one. And

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,890
that's why we haven't read em in
the right column, which is the

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,980
working directory. So we have
some changes here. But these

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,610
changes are not in the staging
area. That's why we don't have

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,300
anything in the left column. Now
file three is a new file. That's

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,770
why we have two question marks
in both this columns. Now, let's

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,720
add file one to the staging
area. So get Add File one, and

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,890
then do another short status.
Look. For file one, we have a

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,700
green m in the left column or
the staging area column. So all

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,310
the changes that we had in the
working area are now in the

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,370
staging area. in the right
column, we don't have anything

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,490
we don't have any extra changes.
That earlier in this section, I

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,520
told you that made me a stage of
file, get takes a snapshot of

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,970
that file and puts it in the
staging area. So if we modify

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,390
that file after we have to
restate the changes, let me show

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,330
you this one more time. So I
want to modify a file one more

32
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,970
time. Let's echo ocean to File
one dot j s, and then run git

33
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,350
status dash s, look what we have
here. So in the left column, we

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,170
have a green arrow, which means
we have some changes in the

35
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,470
staging area, we have some
additional changes in the

36
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,920
working directory that are not
added to the staging area. Okay,

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,660
so let's add file one to the
staging area one more time. And

38
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,430
then run git status dash rats,
the all the changes that we had

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,910
in the working directory are now
in the staging area. So we're

40
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,870
done with file one. Let's look
at file two. So I'm going to add

41
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,910
file two to the staging area as
well. And then run git status

42
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,590
dash s. For file two, we haven't
green a in the left column,

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,490
which represents added. So file
two is added and file one is

44
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,610
modified and this is how the
short status output works.
