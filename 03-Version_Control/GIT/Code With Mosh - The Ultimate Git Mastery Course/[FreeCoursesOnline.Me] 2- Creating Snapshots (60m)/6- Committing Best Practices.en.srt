00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,300
Let's talk about the best
practices for committing code.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,180
First of all your commits
shouldn't be too big or too

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,090
small. We don't want to make a
commit, every time we update a

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,520
file, that's just useless.
Because we'll end up with

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,640
commits like update five, one
update file to occupy three,

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,490
it's just useless. On the other
hand, we don't want our commits

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,700
to be too big, we don't want to
wait and implement a feature end

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,280
to end before committing it. We
don't want to code for three

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,770
days and then make a commit,
because the whole point of

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,010
committing is to record
checkpoints as we go. So if you

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,880
screw up, we can always go back
and recover our code. So try to

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,730
commit often, in the real world,
you might commit five to 10

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,160
times a day or even more,
depending on the kind of work

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,920
you're doing. But this is just a
basic guideline. Don't take it

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,880
as a rule. Don't try to aim for
five or 10 commits a day. So as

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,670
you're coding, as you reach a
state you want to record then

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,850
make a commit. And also, each
commit should represent a

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,480
logically separate chain set. So
don't mix things up. For

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,390
example, if you're fixing a bug,
and then you accidentally Find a

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,630
typo in your app, you shouldn't
come in both this changes in one

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,630
commit, you should have two
separate commits, one commit for

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,630
the typo, another one for the
bug fix. Now, if you

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,200
accidentally stage both these
changes, we can easily onstage

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
them. I'll show you how to do
this later in the section. Next,

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,780
you should give yourself the
habit of creating meaningful

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,720
commit messages. Because all of
these messages are going to show

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,660
up in history. So if your
messages are cryptic, they're

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,360
not going to be helpful to you
or other team members. If you

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,170
follow my previous advice, if a
commit represents a single unit

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,930
of work, it would be easier to
come up with a message for your

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,140
commit. If you're doing too many
things in one commit, you're not

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,960
going to come up with a good
message. Okay. Now in terms of

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,050
the wording, most people prefer
to use the present tense in

34
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,140
their commit messages. So
instead of fixed a bug, you

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,290
should say, fixed a bug. If you
don't like this convention,

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,230
that's totally fine. But
whatever commercial use, make

37
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,200
sure that you and other team
members stick to it. So always

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,630
take this best practices in mind
when committing code
