1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,840
Let's start by adding a couple
of files to our project. To do

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,360
that, we're gonna use the echo
command. This is not a good

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,480
command, it's just a standard
Unix or Linux command for

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,920
writing content to a file. So
here we're gonna write hello to

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,390
file one dot txt. So here, I'm
working with a txt file. Because

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't want this course to be
specific to people who know a

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,270
particular programming language
like Python or JavaScript. What

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to show you in terms
of the workflow applies to any

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,990
programming languages. Okay? So
we write hello to file one dot

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,160
txt. Good. Now let's execute
this command one more time, and

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,400
change file one to file two. So
now we have two files in our

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,610
project. Now look at this
question mark here. That means

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,670
we have new files here that are
not tracked by git, because the

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,090
first time you initialize a git
repository in a directory, Git

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,030
is not going to automatically
track your files. So if you have

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,690
1000 files in a project, you
have to instruct Git to track

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,700
them. Okay. So here we go. run
git status to see the status of

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,780
the working directory on the
staging area. Take a look. So we

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,200
don't have any comments yet. We
have untracked files, which are

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,620
file one and file two. They're
indicated by red because they're

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,800
not in the staging area yet. To
add these files to the staging

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,760
area, we use the git add
command. Here we can list a

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,720
single file, like file one dot
txt, or multiple files separated

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,740
by a space. We can also use
patterns. So star dot txt, that

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,090
means all the files with a txt
extension, we also have period,

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,240
which adds the entire directory
recursively. But you have to be

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,610
a little bit careful with this.
Because sometimes there are

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,790
files you don't want to add to
your repository, perhaps large

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,060
files like large binary files or
lock files, you don't want to

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,060
add this faster repository,
because they increase the size

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,820
of your repository. I will show
you how to ignore this files

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,360
later in this section. So just
remember, add period adds the

33
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,690
entire directory recursively in
this demo, I'm going to go with

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,910
this command, because we only
have two files in this

35
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,570
directory, okay? Now our green
indicator change to yellow,

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,900
which means we have stuff in the
staging area that are ready to

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,880
be committed. So if we run git
status again, look, we have two

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,000
new files, and they're indicated
by green, which means they're in

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,760
the staging area. Now, let me
show you something interesting.

40
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,510
I'm going to modify a file one.
So once again, we're gonna use

41
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,370
the echo command to echo world.
But here instead of one greater

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,310
than sign, I'm going to use two
greater than signs, which means

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,500
a pet. So we're going to append
world to file one dot txt. Now

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,700
let's run git status again, look
what happened. We have two files

45
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,880
in the staging area, because
they're indicated by green. But

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,930
we also have one modified file
in our working directory. So you

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,840
might be asking, but hey, Marsh,
didn't we already Add File one

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,990
to staging area? Yes, we did.
But when you run the Add

49
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,710
command, get took a snapshot of
file one And out of that

50
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,550
snapshot to the staging area. So
here's the current situation. In

51
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,730
the staging area, we have the
first version of file one, we

52
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,270
change this file after we added
it to the staging area. So what

53
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,270
we currently have in our working
directory is the second version

54
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,360
of this file. It has some
changes that are not staged yet.

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,700
So back to the terminal. We run
git add period or git add file

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,050
one dot txt one more time. Now
look at the status of our

57
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,990
working directory. Both these
files are in the staging area,

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
and we don't have any unstaged
changes. So next, I'm going to

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,410
show you how to commit this
snapshot to permanently store it

60
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,580
in our Git repository.
