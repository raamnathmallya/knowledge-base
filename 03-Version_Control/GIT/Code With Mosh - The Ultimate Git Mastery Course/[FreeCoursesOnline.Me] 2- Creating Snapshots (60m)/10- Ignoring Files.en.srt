1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,569
In almost every project, we
should tell Git to ignore

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,539
certain files and directories.
For example, we don't want to

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,139
include lock files or binary
files that get generated as a

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,169
result of compiling our code.
And adding those files is just

5
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:19,169
going to increase the size of
our repository without providing

6
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:22,109
any values. every developer can
have their own lock files,

7
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:25,349
right? So lock files are not
something we want to share and

8
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:28,949
synchronize with other team
members. So for this demo, this

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,009
creates a directory called logs,
and then add a log file here.

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,329
Once again, we can use the echo
command to write hello to logs

11
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,729
slash dev deadlock. Now let's
run git status. So getting

12
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,269
saying that we have an untracked
directory called logs. But we

13
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:47,549
don't want to add this to the
staging area, because we don't

14
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,419
want Git to track this. So to
prevent this, we have to create

15
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:55,829
a special file called dot Git
ignore. So this file has no

16
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,009
name. It only has an extension
and it should be in the root of

17
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:05,699
your project. So let's echo logs
forward slash to dot, git

18
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:09,239
ignore. Now I'm going to open
this file using VS code. So

19
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,799
code, git ignore. So in this
file, we have a single entry

20
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,759
logs, forward slash, which
indicates a directory, we can

21
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,369
list as many files and
directories we want here. For

22
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,389
example, we can include main dot
log, we can also use patterns,

23
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,349
like all log files, and so on.
Once we are done, we save the

24
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,549
changes back in the terminal.
Now, if you run git status one

25
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,729
more time, it no longer says
that we have a new directory

26
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,909
called locks, because it's
ignoring it. Instead, it says,

27
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:43,589
we have a new file called dot
Git ignore. So let's add this

28
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:48,659
file to the staging area and
then commit our code. So add,

29
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,399
git ignore. So this is how we
can ignore files and directories

30
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,879
and get. Just remember, this
only works if you haven't

31
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,419
already included a file or a
directory in your repository. In

32
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:03,089
other words, if you accidentally
include a file in your

33
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,509
repository, and then later added
to Git ignore, Git is not gonna

34
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,259
ignore that. Let me show you. So
let's create a new directory

35
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,709
called ban. And let's imagine
that this directory contains our

36
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,729
compiled source code. So using
the echo command, I'm going to

37
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:23,219
write hello to ban slash app
that bear. Now let's run git

38
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,669
status. So we have a new
directory. Now we want to

39
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:31,469
accidentally commit this to our
repository. So we add all the

40
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:34,289
changes, and then come in our
code

41
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,240
admin.

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,950
Here's the problem. Every time
it compiled our code, Git is

43
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,420
going to say that this file, bin
slash after bin is changed. So

44
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,790
we have to stage it and then
commit it. It doesn't make

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,970
sense. Why do we have to commit
this file every time we compile

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,440
our application? So back to Git
ignore? Let's add the bin

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,700
directory here as well. Back in
the terminal, let's run git

48
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,720
status. So we have modified Git
ignore beautiful, let's date and

49
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,280
commit this change. So git add,
period. And then git commit,

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,660
include in slash, and Git
ignore. Now in this case, Git is

51
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,450
not going to ignore the changes
in this directory, because it's

52
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,770
already tracking this directory.
So let's modify our bin file by

53
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:30,390
saying echo hello world to bin
slash app, that bin get status.

54
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,470
Look good is saying that this
file is modified. This is not

55
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,650
what we want. To solve this
problem, we have to remove this

56
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,170
file from the staging area,
which is what we're proposing

57
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,820
for the next commit. So earlier
we talked about get LS dash

58
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,660
files. This command shows the
files in our staging area. So as

59
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,350
you can see, this bin file or
the bin directory is already in

60
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,100
the staging area. We should
remove it here How? Well earlier

61
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,850
we talked about the Git remote
command. I told you that with

62
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,760
this Command, we can remove a
file or a directory from both

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,880
the working directory as well as
the staging area. But in this

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,160
case, we don't want to remove
this file from our working

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,190
directory, because that's how we
launch our application. So we

66
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,730
want to remove this file only
from the staging area, how well

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,760
let's add dash H for a quick
help. So we type Git RM and then

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,840
we can add zero or more options.
Here we have this option called

69
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,130
dash dash cash. And with this we
can remove stuff only from the

70
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,820
index index is the alternate for
the staging area. So when you

71
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,390
look at Git documentation, most
of the time you see index. So

72
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,450
using this option, we can remove
the bin directory from the

73
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:46,830
index. So Git RM dash dash
cached bin for slash. Now we get

74
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,120
an error saying not removing bin
recursively without dash R. So

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,620
one more time. Let's look at the
help for this command. We have

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,730
another option called dash r for
recursive removal. So we've been

77
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,420
removed The entire bin directory
from the staging area. To do

78
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,480
that we type Git RM, dash dash
cash dash r bin, forward slash.

79
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,990
Beautiful. Now this entire
directory is removed from the

80
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,630
staging area. Let's verify. So
get LS files, our bin directory

81
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,610
is no longer here. Now let's run
git status. Look, we have one

82
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,450
change that is ready to be
committed. This directory is

83
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,280
deleted from our staging area.
So let's commit the change and

84
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:38,160
remove the bin directory that
was accidentally committed.

85
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,200
Okay, from this point forward,
Git is no longer going to track

86
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,080
the changes in this directory.
So if we echo test to bin slash

87
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,260
after bin, you can see our
working directory is still

88
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,050
clean, we don't have any
changes. We can verify it using

89
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,440
git status as well. So this is
how we can ignore files and

90
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,460
directories and Git Now if you
head over to github.com, slash

91
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,210
GitHub slash category, you can
see various Git ignore templates

92
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,450
for different programming
languages. For example, let's

93
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:15,570
look at the template for Java.
So for Java projects, it's a

94
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,990
great idea to exclude all the
class files, because these files

95
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,750
get automatically generated when
you compile your code, so

96
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,750
there's no need to include them
in your repository. So here we

97
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,900
have various patterns, like all
the class files, or all the log

98
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,320
files, the lines that start with
a high sign. These are comments

99
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,700
so they get ignored by Git
