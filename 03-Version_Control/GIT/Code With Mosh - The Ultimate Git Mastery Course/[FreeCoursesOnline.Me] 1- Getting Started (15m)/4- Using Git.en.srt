00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's talk about various ways to
use Git. We can use Git on the

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,780
command line. So we open a
terminal or command prompt

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,620
window to execute Git commands.
This is the fastest, and

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,370
sometimes the easiest way to get
the job done. That's why a lot

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,980
of people use the command line.
If you don't like the command

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,700
line, Well, you're in luck.
Because most modern code editors

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,930
on IDs have built in support for
basic Git features. For example,

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,930
in VS code, we have the source
control panel, which gives us

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,780
the essential Git features.
There are also extensions

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,170
available for bringing
additional Git features. For VS

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,220
code. The most popular extension
is GitLance. It brings a ton of

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,250
Git features and VS code.
They're also graphical user

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,820
interfaces specifically made for
using Git. Here are the Git

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,460
websites you can find the
complete list of these tools for

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,360
different platforms. We have
tools for Windows, Mac, Linux,

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,280
Android and iOS. Out all these,
the two most popular tools are

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,880
GitKraken in source tree.
GitKraken  is my personal

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,390
Favorite GUI tool. Forget, it's
beautifully designed. It works

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,270
across different platforms. And
it integrates with other

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,540
GitKraken  products, such as
GitKraken  boards for issue

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,360
tracking, and GitKraken
timelines for project

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,450
management. It's free for open
source projects. But for

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,870
commercial projects, you have to
pay an annual fee. Just to let

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,750
you know, I'm not an affiliate
of GitKraken , I'm just a fan.

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,530
The other option is source tree.
It's completely free, but it's

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,130
only available for Windows and
Mac. So if you're a Linux user,

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,490
you have to use GitKraken  or
another GUI tool. In this

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,580
course, we'll be spending most
of our time on the command line

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,340
for a couple of reasons. The
first reason is that pretty much

30
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,400
all of these GUI tools have some
limitations. They support the

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,910
Git commands that people use
most of the time. So even if you

32
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,580
want to use a GUI tool, there
are times you would have to roll

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,520
up your sleeves and get back to
the command line to get the job

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,580
done. And the other reason is
that the command line is always

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,520
available, but there are
situations where a GUI tool may

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,130
not be available to you. You
might connect to a server

37
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,760
remotely

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,060
And he may not have permission
to install a GUI tool. If you

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,520
don't know how to use the
command line, then you're stuck.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,150
In practice, a lot of people,
including myself, use both the

41
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,610
command line and a GUI tool. And
that's what I'm going to show

42
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,250
you in this course, there are
times that it really makes sense

43
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,770
to use a GUI tool and another
command line. But there are

44
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,410
other times that using the
command line is faster and

45
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,680
easier. So we'll use the command
line. At the end of the day, you

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,650
should use the right tool for
the job. Don't be like this guy.

47
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,070
You probably know him, our
popular superstar developer

48
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,280
called John Smith. He thinks
he's better than everyone else,

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,370
because he does everything in
the command line. He never uses

50
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,000
a GUI tool and he looks down at
people who do, well let him thin

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
whatever he wants, if that'
what makes him happy, who cares

52
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,240
So we'll be spending most of ou
time on the command line. Bu

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,640
when it makes sense to use a GU
tool, I'll be showing yo

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,760
examples in VS code and Gi
Kraken because those are the m

55
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,520
st popular tools. Now if y
u've never worked with a c

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,800
mmand line before, don't w
rry, I'm going to hold your h

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,250
nds and teach you everything s
ep by step. It's a lot easier t

58
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,820
an you think.

59
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:01,709
Next we're going to install Git
