1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,400
So what is Git? And why is it so
popular? Git is the most popular

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,790
version control system in the
world. A version control system

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,150
records the changes made to our
code over time, in a special

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,660
database called repository, we
can look at our project history

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,710
and see who has made, what
changes, when and why. And if we

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,770
screw something up, we can
easily revert our project back

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,340
to an earlier state. Without a
version control system will have

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,850
to constantly store copies of
the entire project in various

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,540
folders. This is very slow and
doesn't scale at all, especially

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,840
if multiple people have to work
on the same project, you will

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,290
have to constantly toss around
the latest code by email or some

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,100
other mechanisms, and then
manually merge the changes. So

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,640
in a nutshell, with a version
control system, we can track our

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,850
project history and work
together. Now, version control

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,750
systems fall into two
categories, centralized and

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,800
distributed. In a centralized
system, all team members connect

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,340
to a central server to get the
latest copy of the code, and to

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,880
share the changes with others.
So version and Microsoft Team

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,330
Foundation Server are examples
of centralized version control

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,540
systems. The problem with the
centralized architecture is the

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,350
single point of failure. If the
server goes offline, we cannot

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,100
collaborate or save snapshots of
our project. So we have to wait

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,670
until the server comes back
online. In distributed systems,

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,030
we don't have these problems.
Every team member has a copy of

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,270
the project with his history on
their machine, so we can save

26
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,930
snapshots of our project locally
on our machine. If the central

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,930
server is offline, we can
synchronize our work directly

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,710
with others. Git and Mercurial
are examples of distributed

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,580
version control systems. Out of
all these, Git is the most

30
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,730
popular version control system
in the world because it's free,

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,780
open source, super fast and
scalable. Operations like

32
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,810
branching and merging are slow
and painful in other version

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,620
control systems, like subversion
or TFS. But they're very fast

34
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,010
in Git we'll talk about this
ater. So Git is almost

35
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,130
verywhere. More than 90% of
oftware projects in the world

36
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,850
se Git. That's why almost every
ob description for software

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,240
eveloper mentions Git. So if
ou're looking for a job as a

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,240
oftware developer Git is one of
the skills you must have on yo

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,360
r resume. You should know it in
ide out. You should know how it

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,660
works, and how to use it to tr
ck your project history and co

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,990
laborate with others ef
ectively. And that's exactly wh

42
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,460
t you're going to learn in th
s course.
