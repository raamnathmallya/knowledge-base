00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,630
Alright, before we get started,
let me tell you something super

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,690
important real quick. If you
want to get the most out of this

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,110
Git course and become a git
expert, you should watch every

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,230
lesson in order. Don't skip any
lessons, even if you think you

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,410
know the basics. And trust me,
there's a lot of bad information

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,530
and misconceptions about Git out
there. A lot of people don't

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,620
know how Git really works. And
that's why they constantly screw

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,950
things up and jump on Stack
Overflow for help. I don't want

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,800
you to be one of them. So I've
put tremendous effort into

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,500
creating this course, to make
sure you really understand how

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,680
Git works and how you can use it
like a pro. But that would only

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,460
happen if you watch every single
lesson in order. This course is

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,460
short and sweet. It's only five
hours long, but teaches you a

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,970
ton. You know me I'm not going
to waste your time with bs. With

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,860
that, now let's move on to the
next lesson.
