Welcome to my ultimate git
mastery course. Over the next

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,420
five hours, you're going to
learn everything you need to

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,660
know to use git like a pro, and
work effectively with others.

00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,210
We're going to start off by
talking about the fundamental

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,750
concepts like what is git, how
to install and configure it. And

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,510
then in each section, we're
gonna explore a different set of

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,500
git tools will cover creating
snapshots of your code, browsing

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,770
your project history, branching
and merging, collaborating with

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,800
others using GitHub and
rewriting history. I'm Mosh
