00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,380
Alright, let's see if you have
Git on your machine or not. And

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,920
if yes, what version you have in
stock. To do this, you have to

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,340
open a terminal or command
prompt window. If you're on Mac,

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,430
press Command space, and then
type terminal. If you're on

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,270
Windows, click the Search icon
on the bottom navigation bar and

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,070
type cmd. So here's my terminal
or console window, your terminal

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,890
window might look different, it
doesn't matter. This is where

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,680
we're going to execute Git
commands. So let's look at the

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,790
version of Git on this machine.
We type Git dash dash version.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,320
So on this machine, I'm using
Git version 2.19.2. But the late

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,590
t version, at the time of recor
ing this video is 2.27.0. So I

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,490
highly encourage you to
download and install the late

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,020
t version. Just head over to git
SCM comm/downloads. Over here,

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,470
ou can find instructions for
nstalling Git on different opera

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,140
ing systems. It's really e
sy, you're not gonna have

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,510
ny problems. Now if you'r
on Windows, once you inst

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,510
ll Git you're going this appl
cation called git bas

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,710
, which is short for born ag
in shell. This is basically a c

19
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,740
mmand prompt window like t
is one over here, but it emulat

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,610
s Unix or Linux environments.
o throughout this course, I en

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,160
ourage you to use Git Bas
instead of the built in comm

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,220
nd prompt window. So what you s
e on the screen looks closer t

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,500
what I'm going to show you i
this course. So go ahead and

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,890
install Git. In the next les
on, I'm going to show you how to

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,530
customize our Git environmen
.
