00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,720
In this section, we'll look at
various ways to browse the

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,290
history of our project, you will
learn how to search for commits

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,370
by author, date, message,
content, and so on. We'll also

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,550
talk about viewing a commit to
see what files have been changed

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,850
and how. Next I'll show you how
to restore your project to an

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,910
earlier point in time to the
snapshot stored in one of your

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,690
commits. We'll also see how we
can compare a commit to see what

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,510
files have been changed and how
you will also learn to view the

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,080
history of a file to see how
it's evolved from day one, and

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,840
who has written each line of
code. And finally, I'll show you

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,530
a great tool for quickly finding
a bad commit that introduced a

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,960
bug in your application. So
there's a lot we're going to

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,940
cover. Let's jump in and get
started.
