1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,870
So here's the default output of
the log command. Now, if this is

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,330
not what you want, and you don't
like the one line option,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,720
either, you can easily customize
the output of the log command.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,810
Let me show you how. So we type
Git log, dash dash, pretty

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,580
equals format, colon, double
quotes. I know this is a little

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,860
bit long. But the good thing is
you don't have to memorize any

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,470
of these things, you can always
go back to the documentation or

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,620
look at the cheat sheet that
I've provided for you. So here

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,370
in double quotes, we can specify
a format string, this format

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,910
string can be a combination of
plaintext, and some placeholders

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,090
that will get replaced by git to
display pieces of information

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,070
about each commit. For example,
if I type Hello here, for each

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,580
commit, we see the word hello,
of course, this is useless. So

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,250
here, we want to display
information dynamically. Let's

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,310
bring up this command one more
time. And after the word hello,

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,050
type percent, a n, which is
short for author name. Now take

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,980
a look. For each commit, we can
see the author name, right after

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,640
the word hello.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,320
Let's make this more
interesting.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,150
So I'm going

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,590
to remove hello and say, person
am I committed now here we want

22
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,660
to display the commit ID or
hash, so use percent capital H.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,070
Now we can see the author name,
right after that see committed

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,460
and here's the full hash for
each commit. This is too

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,280
verbose. So we can use the
lowercase h to see the

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,030
abbreviation

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,530
like this.

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,500
That is better.

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,490
If you look at the documentation
for the log command, somewhere

30
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,920
in the middle of the page, you
can see the complete list of

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
these placeholders. So we have
capital H, for displaying the

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,060
commit hash, or lowercase h for
displaying the abbreviated

33
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,200
commit hash, we have quite a few
other placeholders. So back to

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,530
the terminal. Let's take this to
the next level. So right after

35
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,300
the hash we can say on and here
we can display the date, percent

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,310
CD, that is commit date. There
you go. So you can customize the

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,640
output of the lock command any
way that suits your needs. Now

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,520
we can also colorize this
output. For example, we can

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,130
display the author name in
green. Let me show you how to do

40
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,510
this. So we bring up the last
command. Just before the author

41
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,830
name, we type percent, capital
C, and then lowercase green.

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,240
Look, here we have two
placeholders. The first

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,780
placeholder

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,530
is for changing the color. And
the second placeholder is for

45
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,340
displaying the author name. Now,
everything comes out in green,

46
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,370
because we didn't change the
color after displaying the

47
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,170
author name. So let's bring up
the last command. Right after

48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,100
the author name, we can type
percent, capital C, and the

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,440
lowercase reset. That's much
better. Similarly, we can use a

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,490
different color for the commit
ID, and the date or other pieces

51
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,370
of information we have here.
Once again, back to the

52
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,950
documentation for the log
ommand. Here you can see

53
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,800
arious placeholders for
hanging the color. So we have

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,080
, red, C, green, C Blue C reset
and C in parenthesis, we can

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,680
supply a custom color. Now in
eality, you're not going to rem

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,590
mber all these details every ti
e when I look at the history. So

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,990
in the next lesson, I'm going to
show you how to create an al

58
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,700
as for this long command.
