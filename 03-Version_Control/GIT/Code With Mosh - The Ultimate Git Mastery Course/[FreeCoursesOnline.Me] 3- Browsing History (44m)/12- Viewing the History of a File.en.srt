00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,479
Let's see how we can view the
history of a file. For example,

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:10,169
we have this file here, table of
content dot txt, let's find all

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,099
the commits that have touched
this file. So we run git log

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,409
table of content, the txt. If
this is too verbose, we can use

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,329
the one line option. That's
better. Now we can find

6
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,419
statistics about each commit in
terms of the number of changes

7
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:32,429
using the stat option. We have
seen this before. Now we know in

8
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,259
this commit, we have one
insertion and one deletion. In

9
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,749
this other commit, we have more
changes. So then we can view

10
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,389
that particular commit in
detail. If we want to see the

11
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:46,349
actual changes in each commit,
we can use the patch option. So

12
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,569
instead of stop use patch. Now
we know in this command, which

13
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:55,469
is our last command, this line
was removed and replaced by

14
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,209
blackline. In the other command,
before that, we added these few

15
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:04,079
lines and so on. So to view the
history of a file, we still use

16
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,659
the lock command, but we append
the file name at the end
