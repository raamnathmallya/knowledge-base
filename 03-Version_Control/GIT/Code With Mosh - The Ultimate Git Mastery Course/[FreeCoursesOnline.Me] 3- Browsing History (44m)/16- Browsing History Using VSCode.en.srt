1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,270
Let's see how we can use VS code
to view the history of our

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,270
project. To do that, you have to
install an extension called

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,890
GitLens. So go to the extensions
panel and search for GitLens.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,490
It's right here. This is a very
popular extension, look at the

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,760
number of downloads, it's over 6
million times. So once you

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,330
install this, you're going to
see a new icon over here. That

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,310
is GitLens. Now on the top,
let's go to repositories. Here's

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,400
our Venice repository. And we're
currently on the master branch.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,940
Let's open the master branch.
Here are the commits on this

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,330
branch. For each commit, we can
see the message we can see the

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,090
author and we can see the number
of files that were added,

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,820
modified, and deleted. Now if we
expand any of these commits, we

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,330
can see all the files that were
changed in that commit. If we

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,840
click on any of these files, we
can see a diff of the changes.

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,440
So this line was removed. And
these two lines were added.

16
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,710
Pretty helpful. Now, let me
close the master branch. So over

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,320
here, we can see all the
branches, we have, we'll look at

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,980
branches. In the next section,
we can see the contributors. So

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,790
here are all the people who have
contributed to this repository.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,940
In this case, I'm listed twice,
because I've created some of

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,030
these commits on another machine
with a different email. So that

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,310
is why I'm listed twice here.
Now, we also have our tags.

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,390
Currently, we have a single tag,
version 1.0 that is referencing

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,310
this commit. Now let's look at
some File History. So this File

25
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,190
History panel works when we have
a file open in the editor. So

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,360
I'm going to open our table of
content file. Now back to

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,700
GitLens. In a File History
panel, we can see all the

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,090
commits that have touched this
file. Once again, if you click

29
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,180
on any of this commits, we can
see the lines that were added or

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,920
deleted. Now let's see how we
can compare commits. So we click

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,250
on this, we have to select two
commits. Here, we can type a

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,670
commit ID or a relative
reference using head I want to

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,490
comprehend with head till
they're six. So these are all

34
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,490
the files that have been changed
across these two commits. If you

35
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,730
click on any of these files, we
can see the exact lines are

36
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,580
added or deleted. Now let's look
at search commands. So we can

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,590
search by message, author commit
ID files, or changes. So let's

38
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,700
search by a message. So after
message for type, a keyword,

39
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,840
let's say GUI. This is the only
commit that has the word GUI in

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,630
its message. Now earlier in the
course, I told you that all

41
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,660
these GUI tools have some
limitations. For example, here,

42
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,960
we cannot apply a second filter,
we can only search by a single

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,710
filter, like message, author,
and so on. If I have so many

44
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,830
commits with a particular
keyword in their message, and

45
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,890
then I want to filter the range
to a particular date range, I

46
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,830
cannot do that here, I have to
go back to the terminal. Another

47
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,160
limitation we have here is the
lack of bisect command, so we

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,610
cannot use bisect to quickly
find a bad commit. For that,

49
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,400
again, we have to go back to the
terminal. That is the reason why

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,160
I'm personally not a fan of GUI
tools, I prefer to do things

51
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,100
mostly on the terminal. GUI
tools are great for diffing s

52
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,130
eing exactly how the code is m
dified from one commit to a

53
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,310
other. Now, one last thing b
fore we finish this lesson, l

54
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,910
t me show you how to create a
d delete tags. So we have to

55
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,240
ring up the command palette. On
ac the shortcut is shift

56
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,890
ommand and P and on Windows is
robaby shift control NP. If t

57
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,410
is doesn't work on your m
chine, go to the View menu on t

58
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,710
e top and find the command p
lette. It's the first item. U

59
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,320
fortunately, it's not visible i
my recording window right n

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,190
w. So let's bring up the c
mmand palette, and type get t

61
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,060
g. Now we can see all the c
mmands related to tags. So we c

62
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,330
n create, delete, or push t
gs. We'll talk about pushing t

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,050
gs in the future. So let's c
eate a tag. We give it a name, l

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,510
t's say version 1.2. We type a m
ssage. And now we have a new t

65
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,990
g associated with the latest c
mmit. So if you go to r

66
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,390
positories, and tags, here's o
r tag. If you want to create a t

67
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,170
g for an earlier commit, you h
ve to find that commit first. S

68
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,220
let's say we want to add a t
g to this commit right here. W

69
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,490
right click and select Create t
g.
