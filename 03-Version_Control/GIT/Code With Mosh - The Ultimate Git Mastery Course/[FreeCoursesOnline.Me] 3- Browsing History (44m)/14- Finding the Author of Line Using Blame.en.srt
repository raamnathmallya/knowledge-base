00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,989
Another useful tool in Git is
the blame tool. With this, we

2
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:10,109
can find the author of a
particular line. So as part of

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,809
troubleshooting issues, we may
wonder who has written that

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,229
terrible, smelly, disgusting
line of code. That's where we

5
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:19,019
use the blame tool to basically
blame them for writing that

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,069
piece of code. Here's an
example. Get blame audience dot

7
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:27,779
txt. Now, in front of each line
of code in this file, we have

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,239
some extra pieces of
information, we can see the

9
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,539
commit where this line was
inserted, we can see the

10
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,339
author's name and the date and
time this line was inserted. Now

11
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:42,179
if we want to find the author's
email, we use the dash E,

12
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:47,849
option, dash E and set up the
name we have the email, we can

13
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:50,819
also filter by lines. So if you
have a large file, we don't want

14
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:53,999
to see all these details. Let's
say we're only interested in the

15
00:00:53,999 --> 00:01:01,139
first three lines. So we type
Git blame dash, capital L, and

16
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:03,329
here we say one, comma three.

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,810
Now we only see the first three
lines.
