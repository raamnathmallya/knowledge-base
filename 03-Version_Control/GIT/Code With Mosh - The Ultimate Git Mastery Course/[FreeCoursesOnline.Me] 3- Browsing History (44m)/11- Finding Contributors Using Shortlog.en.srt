1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,780
Sometimes we need to find all
the people who have contributed

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,990
to our project, we have a
special command for that get

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,220
short log. so here we can see
y name, the number of commits

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,060
've created, and a summary of
ommit messages. Here we have

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,280
arious interesting options. So
et's run git short log dash H.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,690
or example, we can use dash n
r dash dash numbered, whatever

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,230
ou prefer. to sort the output
ased on the number of commits

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,550
er author, we can use dash s to
uppress commit descriptions,

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,600
nd dash E to show email a
dresses. For example, we can s

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,940
y get short log dash n. Now t
is is sorted based on the n

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,640
mber of commits per author. In t
is repository, we have a s

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,730
ngle author, so the output d
esn't really change, but we c

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,950
n add a dash s to suppress the c
mmit messages. Now we can only s

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,220
e the number of commits per a
thor. Now in addition to this, w

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,240
can pass dash e to the email a
dress of each author. So with t

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,810
is we can easily find the most a
tive contributors. Here we can a

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,190
so filter the list for e
ample, we can use before and o

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,340
after options that we talked a
out earlier, to view the c

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,020
ntributors per given date r
nge.
