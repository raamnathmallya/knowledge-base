1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,359
The first thing we're going to
look at is the lock command that

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,369
you learned about in the
previous section. In this

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,229
lesson, we're going to study
this command in a bit more

4
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:15,629
detail. So here in the Venus
directory, let's run git log. so

5
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:18,629
here we can see all the commits
in this repository. For each

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,169
commit, we can see its unique
identifier or hash, we can see

7
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:26,309
its author, the author, name,
and email, the date and time it

8
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,419
was created, and the one liner
message or subject. Now by

9
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,879
default, all these commits are
listed from the newest to the

10
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,969
oldest. So here's our last
commit. Now, because we have

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,089
multiple pages here, we can
press space to go to the next

12
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:43,709
page, we can also use the up and
down arrows to go up and down

13
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,289
like this. Now to quit, we press
Q. Okay. Now let's look at some

14
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,889
of the interesting options of
this command. So git log, one of

15
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:55,889
them that you already know is
one line, which gives us a

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,699
summary of all his commands, we
can add additional options here.

17
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,519
For example, if you want to see
all the files that have been

18
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:08,219
changed in each commit, we can
use the stat option, take a

19
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,029
look. So in our last commit,
five files have been changed.

20
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,669
Here, you can see the name of
these files, we have audience

21
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:18,569
dot txt, objectives and so on.
In front of each file, you can

22
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,319
see the number of changes. So
for audience dot txt, we have

23
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,849
four changes, we have three
insertions and one deletion. So

24
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,239
three lines were inserted and
one line was deleted. In total,

25
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,149
five files have been changed.
several lines have been inserted

26
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:35,669
and four lines have been
deleted. Now, we don't

27
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:38,459
necessarily have to use this
option with the one line option.

28
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,099
For example, we can run git log
stat. Now we have the full

29
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,189
details about each commit. Okay?
Now what if you want to see the

30
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,449
actual changes in each commit,
we can use the patch option. So

31
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,979
git log, I'm going to use one
line and then patch. So in our

32
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,139
last commit, here, we can see a
diff of audience dot txt. So

33
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:09,089
hese two lines were inserted.
his line was removed, and then

34
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,319
his line was added. Right after
hat we have a diff of another

35
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,559
ile. So for each file, we can
ee exactly what lines have been

36
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,989
hanged and in the next lesson,
'm going to show you how to

37
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:19,949
ilter the history
