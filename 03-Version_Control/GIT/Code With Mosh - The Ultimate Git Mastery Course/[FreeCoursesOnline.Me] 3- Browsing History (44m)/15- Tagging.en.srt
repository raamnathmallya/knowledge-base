1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,720
Quite often, we need to bookmark
certain points in the history of

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,750
our project, like the commit
that represents a given version,

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,660
we use tags for this purpose,
let me show you how this works.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,410
So let's say this code over
here, the last commit represents

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,080
the first version of our
software. So we can give it a

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,140
tag or a custom label. So we
type Git tag, version 1.0. Now,

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,660
if you want to tag an earlier
commit, we have to type the

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,110
commit ID or the commit hash
here, like 5 E 78828. Now, le

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,720
's look at our log again. So lo
k, in front of this commit, we h

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,800
ve a tag a label, we can refere
ce this commit using the tag. So

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,950
if you want to check out t
is commit, we can say git check

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,520
ut version 1.0, exactly the s
me way with check out a com

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,970
it using its ID. But instead of
he ID, we use this tag, or t

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,750
is custom label. Now, to see
ll the tags we have created, t

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,950
pe git tag. Currently, we hav
a single tag, this tag that

16
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,580
we have created is what we cal
a lightweight tag. It's jus

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,820
a reference or a pointer t
a particular commit. But again,

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,940
we have another type of tag cal
ed annotated tag, which i

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,090
a complete object with a bunch
of properties, like tagger na

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,900
e, email, and message. So if
ou want to create an annotated t

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,610
g, we type Git tag, dash a
or annotated, then we type the

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,810
ag name, like version 1.1. And h
re we need to supply a messa

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,700
e, just like creating a commit.
So we can say, my version on po

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,970
nt one, of course, this message
is redundant, there is no po

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,640
nt having this message. But
he idea is that with annota

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,350
ed tags, we can associate a mess
ge with a tag. Now, let's look

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,340
at the list of tags. So git t
g. Currently, we have two tags,

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,020
we don't see their messages. To
ee the message we type Git tag d

29
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,270
sh n. So here's our first t
g, which is a lightweight tag,

30
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,420
he message associated with this
ag is actually the message of

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,980
he commit that it points to.
In contrast, here's our annota

32
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,760
ed tag, which has a custom messa
e. Now let's look at the second

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,010
ag we just created. Git s
ow version 1.1. So on the top,

34
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,160
we have some information about t
is tag, we can see the tags n

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,970
me and email, the date and time
he tag was created, as well as

36
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,850
he custom message we provid
d. Below that we have the f

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,600
ll details of the commit. So qu
te often we prefer annotated t

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,980
gs to lightweight tags. Now,
to delete a tag, we type Git

39
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,710
ag dash D and the type of tag na
e. The tag is gone. So we have o

40
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,300
ly a single tag in our reposito
