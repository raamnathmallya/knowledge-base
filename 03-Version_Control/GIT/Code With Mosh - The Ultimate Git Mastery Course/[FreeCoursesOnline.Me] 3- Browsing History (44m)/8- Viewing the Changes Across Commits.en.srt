1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,290
Now what if we want to see the
changes across two commits. For

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,110
example, let's say we want to
know what has been changed over

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,840
the last three commits. To do
that, we're going to use the

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,810
diff command. In the previous
section, you'll learn how to use

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,380
the diff command to view the
staged and unstaged changes. Now

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,750
we're going to use the same
command to see the differences

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,130
between two commits. So we can
start from head tilda two and go

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,210
to head and now we can see a
diff of every file that has been

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,230
changed across these two
commits. So here we have a diff

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,860
of audience txt. Below that we
can see the changes in

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,100
objectives or txt and so on. If
you want to see the changes to a

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,240
particular file, you can add the
file name at the end. so here we

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,260
can type audience dot txt. Now
we only see the changes in this

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,190
file. Also, similar to the lock
command. Here we have options

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,760
like name, status, and name only
to view the list of files that

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,220
have been changed. So we can say
name only to see the list of

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,200
files that have been changed, or
we can say name status, to see

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
the list of files, or the type
of change. In this case, we only

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,350
have modifications, but if you
had new or deleted files, they

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,550
would be listed here as well.
