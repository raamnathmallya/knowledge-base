1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,959
In Git, we can easily set up
aliases for the commands that we

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:09,899
use frequently. So we don't have
to type them in their long form.

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:14,849
Let me show you. So we type Git
config, dash dash global. So

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,179
this configuration gets applied
to all of our repositories. Here

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,969
in the alias section, we're
going to define a new property.

6
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:25,319
So we type a period. And then we
type a custom command name, for

7
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:29,699
example, LG. And in short for
lock. Now whenever we type git

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,719
LG, we won't get to execute a
particular get command. So we

9
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,249
type that command here, log dash
dash pretty. Now because we have

10
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:41,879
a space here, we should wrap
this value with double quotes.

11
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,579
Okay, so pretty equals format
colon, here, we have to use

12
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,939
double quotes again, to specify
a format string. But because we

13
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,879
have already surrounded the
value with double quotes, I'm

14
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,239
going to replace the inner
quotes with single quotes. Okay,

15
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,789
so here we can say percent as an
as an author name, committed

16
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:08,969
percent H, so here's the result.
Now, let's open up our global

17
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,239
configuration file in our
default editor. So type Git

18
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,479
config, dash dash global dash E.
So here's our Git config file.

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,009
Now, down here, in the alias
section, we have the LG command

20
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,749
that is bound to log with this
pretty format. So now if we

21
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:33,449
close this, and type get LG, we
see the output our custom log

22
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:36,719
ommand. aliases are very
seful. But in this course, I'm

23
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,299
ot going to use them because if
omeone watches the course from

24
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,119
he middle, I don't want them to
onder what is this custom git

25
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,689
ommand that is not documented
nywhere. Okay. Before we finish

26
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,329
his lesson, let me give you
nother useful example of an

27
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:55,379
lias. So let's define another
lias called on stage. With this

28
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,259
e can easily onstage the
hanges. So we're going to bind

29
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,919
his to the Restore command in g
t once again, use double q

30
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:07,229
otes. Here we type restore, d
sh dash staged period. With t

31
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,469
is, you're going to restore a
l the files in the staging a

32
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:15,899
ea. Now we can easily type git o
stage. As simple as that.
