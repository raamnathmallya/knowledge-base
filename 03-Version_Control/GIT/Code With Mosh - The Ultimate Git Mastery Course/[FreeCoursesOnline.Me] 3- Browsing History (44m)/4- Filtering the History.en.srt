1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,109
In this repository, we have just
over 10 commits. But in a real

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,529
repository, we often have
hundreds or sometimes thousands

3
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:13,439
of commits, depending on the age
of the repository. Now, we don't

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,569
have to look at all of these
commits. So let me show you a

5
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:18,479
few different ways to filter the
history. We can filter it by

6
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:22,529
author, by date, by commit
message, by content, and so on.

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,839
So let's run git log one line.
Now, if you want to see the last

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,979
three commands, we simply type
dash three here. There you go.

9
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,499
Now we can also filter by
author. So one line, here, type

10
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:41,789
dash dash author, equals, and
here in double quotes, we type

11
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,869
the author's name, let's say
Mosh. So here are all the

12
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:48,719
commits that I have submitted to
this repository, we can also

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,719
filter by date. So instead of
author we can use before and or

14
00:00:54,839 --> 00:01:00,029
after. So we can say, hey, show
me all the commits from 2020. On

15
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,279
August 17. This will return all
the commits created on this

16
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:09,959
date. And after, take a look. We
can also specify relative dates,

17
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,859
that is pretty useful. For
example, we can say, hey, show

18
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,499
me all the commits from
yesterday. Or we can say, show

19
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:23,999
me all the commits from one week
ago, or two days ago, or one

20
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:27,749
month ago. pretty useful. We can
also filter by commit message or

21
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:31,349
subject. For example, we can
say, hey, show me all the

22
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,729
commits that have the word GUI
and their message, k type, dash

23
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,619
dash, grab, equals. And here in
double quotes, we type the

24
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,669
search term GUI, just remember
that this operation is case

25
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:48,209
sensitive. So if we type GUI in
lowercase, we're going to have a

26
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,079
different result. Take a look.
Here, we have only a single

27
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,969
commit that has the word GUI and
a subject. We can also filter

28
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,729
the history by content, let's
say we want to find all the

29
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,419
commits that have added or
removed a function declaration.

30
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:08,369
So we type, instead of dash dash
grab, we're going to type dash,

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,639
capital S. And here, we're not
going to use an equal sign.

32
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,789
Instead, we're going to add
double quotes. And in between

33
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:17,099
the quotes, we're going to type
our function name, let's say,

34
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,819
all the commits that have added
or remove this line. Now, this

35
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,099
repository, we don't have any
code, we just have plain

36
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,389
English. So let's find all the
commits that have added the word

37
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:32,879
objectives in capital. There you
go, here's the commit. Now, if

38
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,459
you want to see the actual
changes in this commit, we can

39
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,909
use the patch option, you learn
about it in the last video. So

40
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,819
we bring up the last command.
And then at the end, we type

41
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:46,739
dash dash patch. So in this
commit, this file was modified

42
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,959
object dot txt, and over here,
you can see that object is was

43
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,469
inserted, very useful. We can
also filter the history by a

44
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:01,259
range of commits. So let me
bring up all the commands. Let's

45
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,619
say we are only interested in
the commits in a particular

46
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:08,999
range here, let's say from this
commit to this commit over here.

47
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,949
So we can say git log one line.
Here, we add the first commit

48
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:19,589
hash, so FB, 0 d 184. Then we
add double periods. And then we

49
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:26,069
type the target commit ID, like
EDB 3594. Now what if you want

50
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,219
to find all the commits that
touch a particular file or a

51
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:32,999
bunch of files? Well, that is
super easy. We simply type git

52
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:37,229
log, we can optionally use one
line, it's not compulsory. Now

53
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:40,979
if you want to find all the
commits that have modified our

54
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,239
table of content file, we simply
add the file name at the end. So

55
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:48,749
these three commands have
modified this file. Now

56
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,629
sometimes, depending on the name
of your files, it might complain

57
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,499
and say, Hey, this name is
ambiguous. In those cases, we

58
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:59,429
have to separate the file name
from the options over here. So

59
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,599
we bring up the last command.
And here we use double hyphens

60
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:07,019
to separate the file name. From
the options we're using here.

61
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,659
You don't have to use this all
the time, you have to use this

62
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,719
only if we get complaints about
he file name saying, hey, this

63
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:15,449
is ambiguous and I cannot fig
re out what options you're usi

64
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:19,319
g. So in this case, we get the s
me result. Now if you want to

65
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,679
ee the actual changes in each
of these commits, once again, we

66
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,729
can use the patch option. Howe
er, the patch option shoul

67
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,199
be listed before the filename s
we cannot add it over here.

68
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,919
t's not going to work. Because
now after we added double hyp

69
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,639
ens get is interpreting this
s a file name. And there is no

70
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
uch a file called dash dash pa
ch. So to make this work, we hav

71
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,339
to use the patch op

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,110
over here.

73
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,690
Now for each command, we can see
the actual changes in our table

74
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,500
of content file.
