1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,930
Let's see how we can browse the
history using GitKraken. So

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,440
first we go to open a
repository, we go to our project

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,450
directory, and open our
repository. So here's the

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,270
history of our project, we can
clearly see all the commits we

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,600
have created so far. On the left
side, we can see our pointers.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,500
So master branch is just a
pointer to the last commit over

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,280
here. Next to master we have
plus one, which means we have

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,150
another pointer pointing to the
same commit, take a look, that

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,560
is our tag, version 1.2, we have
another tag pointing to this

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,490
commit. Now we can search for
commits right here. And here we

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,780
can find commits by their ID,
author, or message. So if I type

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,890
GUI, this is the only commit t
at has the word GUI in this mes

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,430
age. As I told you before, all
these GUI tools have some lim

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,820
tations. For example, here, we
annot find commits created by

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,610
given author in a par
icular date range, so we can

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,910
ot apply multiple filters. In
hose situations, we just hav

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,030
to go back to the terminal. Now
we can select any of this com

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,420
its to see its details. So her
on the right side, we can see

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,500
the commit ID, message, aut
or, as well as the summary of m

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,100
dified files. So here, we have m
dified five files, we can see a

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,640
l these files listed here, we c
n sort the list in ascending o

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,210
descending order, we can see t
e list in the tree structure o

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,710
in a flat list. Now we have a v
ry useful option here, view a

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,640
l files. So if this commit has m
dified only two files, but you w

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,340
nt to look at the other files i
a project, at that point in tim

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,660
, we can select this and ope
any of these files. For exa

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,680
ple, here, sales page, that txt
hasn't been modified. That's why

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,770
we don't have an icon next to
t. But we can click on it to see

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,040
what it looked like at that poi
t in time. Now, let's look at

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,670
ur table of content file. So her
's the final version of this fil

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,110
storage and this command to see
the actual changes, we go to the

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,890
diff View tab. So you can see
this line was removed and rep

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,730
aced by a blank line. I totally
ove the diff view in GitKra

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,270
en and it makes our job a lot ea
ier. You also have two tabs he

35
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,750
e, blame and history, which ki
d of brings us to the same vi

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,620
w, let me show you. So we can go
to history. Here on the left, yo

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,470
can see all the commits that ha
e touched this file, here's th

38
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,950
first commit. And here's the la
t commit. So as we look at th

39
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,580
s commit, we can see how thi
file has evolved. So let's cha

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,930
ge the diff view to file vie
. In the first commit, our fil

41
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,010
was empty. And the second com
it, we added this lines. And in

42
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,120
he last commit, we removed the
border under the header. Now if

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,700
ou click on the blame tab her
, unfortunately, it's not vis

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,180
ble in my recording window.
But if you click on it, we can t

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,550
ggle blame details. So this
ine was added in this commi

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,450
over here by this person
So we can clearly see who ha

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,750
written what line of code.
ow let's close this window

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,730
And this window as well. Back t
our history, let's see how we

49
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,490
can compare two commits. So I'm
going to compare this commit

50
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,000
with this commit over here.
o select the second commit

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,890
we press Command on Mac, or Ctr
on Windows. Now on the right

52
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,800
ide, you can see we have select
d two commit. And here are the f

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,950
les that have been changed acros
these two commits. So this

54
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,070
s how we can compare commi
s. Now, if you right click on an

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,720
of this commits, we can check
ut that commit. All right,

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,020
now look, the head pointe
is pointing to this commit

57
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,440
so it's in the detached state.
Now to attach it back to the ma

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,880
ter branch, we right click
he master branch and go to che

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,920
kout master. Good. Now one mo
e thing here, we can right

60
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,510
lick a commit and create a tag
r an annotated tag. We have a

61
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,580
bunch of other commands here.
e'll talk about them in the fu

62
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,670
ure. So this is how we can br
wse the history and get cracki

63
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,430
g. That before we finish this l
sson, let me show you anothe

64
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,790
useful feature here. We can br
ng up the command palette by pre

65
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,440
sing Command and P on Mac, o
Ctrl, and P on Windows, the his

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,290
ory of various commands, we can
select the blame command. And

67
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,410
then here we can search for a f
le in our project, let's say tab

68
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,070
e of contents. txt. So we hav
auto completion. This is fan

69
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,810
astic. I love it. So let's loo
at table of content. Now we can

70
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,780
see the full history of this fil
, we can see we accidentally del

71
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,420
ted this file and this com
it, and then added it back ove

72
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,560
here. And of course, if we tog
le the blame details, we can see

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,430
who has written what line of cod
very handy. Now let's bring up

74
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,090
he command palette one more tim
. We can also search for com

75
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,650
its. So we can search by mess
ge like GUI, or by author, or b

76
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,340
commit ID and so on. Withi
the command palette, we can a

77
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,530
so create tags. So let's searc
for tag. Now we can creat

78
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,560
a tag. This will create a tag f
r the last commit in our repos

79
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,280
tory. To create a tag for an ea
lier commit. As I told you,

80
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,730
e have to right click that commi
and go to create tag.
