00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,630
Now let's see how we can view a
commit. We talked about this

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,240
briefly in the previous section.
But let's explore it in a bit

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,940
more detail now. So let's say we
want to view this commit over

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,120
here, there are two ways to
reference this commit, we can

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,660
use the commit ID, or we can use
a relative reference using the

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,750
head pointer. So as we can see,
head is in front of the last

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,010
commit. And this commit we're
interested in, is two commits

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,530
before the last commit. So we
can type git show head Tilda

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,430
two, that means go to the head,
which is the last commit, and

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,920
then go two steps back. So here,
we can see all the details about

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,430
this commit, we can see the
commit ID or commit hash, the

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,540
author of the commit, the date
and time, the subject, and a

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,600
diff of every file that has
changed in this commit. In this

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,870
case, only a single file has
been changed. And that is this

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,920
file over here, staging changes
dot txt. In this file, we have

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,940
two new lines, as we can see
over here, now what if we don't

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,730
want to see the changes, we want
to see the final version of a

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,080
file in this commit? Well, we
bring up the last command, then

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,010
we add a colon. And here we type
the past to our file. So this

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,820
file we're interested in is in a
directory called sections. Here

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,560
we have another directory called
creating dash snapshots. And our

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,210
file is called staging. Dash
changes, a txt. So here's the

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,720
final version of this file
stored in this commit. Now, what

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,030
if we don't want to see the
actual changes or the actual

25
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,000
lines of code in this commit, we
just want to see the files that

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,990
have been modified in this
commit. Well, we type Git show

27
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,900
head tilda two and then we us
an option called name dash on

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,850
y. So over here, we can see al
the files that have been ad

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,140
ed, modified or deleted in th
s commit. With this option, we

30
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,140
can only see the name of the fi
e, so we cannot tell which fi

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,410
es have been added, modified or
deleted. To get that in

32
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,770
ormation, we have to use a di
ferent option called name da

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,440
h status. So now we have the le
ter M here, which means this fi

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,490
e has been modified
