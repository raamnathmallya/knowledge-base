1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,240
Let's see we have pushed all
these commits to a remote

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,750
repository. And now we want to
undo one or more of them. As I

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,720
explained before, resetting the
head is not an option here,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,150
because we don't want to drop
the commits that we have shared

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,510
with others. So we have to use
the revert commit. Now let's say

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,860
we want to revert this commit
over here, we type Git revert

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,240
head, we can also revert an
earlier commit, like head to the

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,340
to, this will revert this commit
over here, we can also specify a

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,280
range. Let's say we want to
revert all the last three

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,030
commits. First, we'll look at
the parent of this commit. So

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,470
that is coming over here. So
here, we say revert had to the

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,120
Three, two head. And here's the
tricky part. When we say head to

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,170
the three to head, we're
referencing this range, but it

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,650
will actually revert the last
three commits. So it's not going

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,820
to include this commit over
here, okay? Now when we run this

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,730
command, Git is going to revert
each of these commits one by

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,210
one, take a look. Let's go.
Alright, first, it's going to

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,330
revert this commit, I'm going to
keep the default message as is.

19
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,890
So let's close this window. Now,
Git is reversing the next

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,370
commit. Once again, I'm going to
keep the default message. So

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,140
let's move on. And here's one
more revert operation. Let's go.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,480
Alright, reverting is done. Now
let's look at our history. Look,

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,710
we have three revert commits.
And this is very ugly, it's

24
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,710
adding so much noise in our
history. Wouldn't it be better

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,620
if you reverted all these
commits using a single commit,

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,620
let me show you how to do that.
First, I want to reset the head

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,180
to this position to get rid of
this revert commits. So Git

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,880
reset dash dash heart had tilde
three. Let's look at our history

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,500
one more time. So we're in the
same state as before, and we

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,090
want to revert the last three
commits, we type Git revert,

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,950
we're going to use an option
called no commit. With this

32
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,130
ption, it will simply add the
equired changes in the staging

33
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,520
rea. So for every commit that
e're going to revert, it will

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,730
igure out the changes that need
o be undone, then it will appl

35
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,690
those changes in the stagin
area. Just like before, we'r

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,520
going to specify our range, s
head tilda three to head. Now,

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,110
we can simplify this by dropping
the second hat. So with this,

38
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,130
we're essentially reverting the
last three commits, take a look.

39
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,540
So get removed this file,
because we added this file in

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,990
one of the last three commits.
Now look, we have some changes

41
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,030
in our staging area. So git
status, dash s. Here's the

42
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,360
reverse of all the changes
across the last three commits.

43
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,110
f you screwed something, and we
ant to get out of this date, we

44
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,150
an type Git revert, abort. Or
f we're happy with our changes,

45
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,310
e can use the continue option.
ow in this case, I don't want

46
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,490
o accept the default message,
ecause we're reverting multiple

47
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,580
ommits. So we should write a
essage that better describes

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,250
he commits that we're
everting. In this demo, I'm

49
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,970
oing to say revert bad code.
ave close. All right, reverting

50
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,530
s done. Let's look at our
istory. Now we have a single

51
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,890
referred commit beautiful, so
e can push this to the origin

52
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,150
nd share it with others.
