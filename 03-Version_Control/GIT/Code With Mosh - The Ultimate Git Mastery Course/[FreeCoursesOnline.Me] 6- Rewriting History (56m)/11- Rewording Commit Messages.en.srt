00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,229
Now let's see how we can rework
commit messages. So earlier I

2
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:10,769
told you that here we have a
wording issue, render

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,879
restaurants on the map, so the
word on is missing.  Once again

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,939
we're going to start interactiv
rebasing. So I'm going to gra

5
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:22,859
this commit ID. Now let's run
it rebase dash i, this commit ca

6
00:00:23,549 --> 00:00:27,989
rot to represent its parent. Al
right, here's the commit you w

7
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,109
nt to reward. Now, we're going t
replace their pick command w

8
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,609
th reword. We can also reword m
ltiple commits. For example, l

9
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:39,239
t's say here, we forgot to i
clude the Google Map SDK v

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,419
rsion. So I'm going to use the r
word commit here as well. Go

11
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,559
d. Now, when I close this wi
dow, it will replay each of th

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,529
se commits. For every commit tha
you want to reword, it's goi

13
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:52,979
g to stop and give us a cha
ce to change the message. So clo

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,819
e. Alright, here's the first com
it you wanted to reword. So rend

15
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:03,269
r restaurants on the map. Good
save, close, get replayed the

16
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:06,239
ther comments, and then he stop
ed at this second commit we want

17
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,709
d to reword. So here I'm goin
to add the version save, clos

18
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,649
. And rebasing was succ
ssful, beautiful. Now let's pull

19
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:20,669
up the history. Now, I want to e
phasize this one more time. In t

20
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,899
is demo, we reworded this comm
t, which caused this commit to b

21
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:28,439
recreated, and that means all
he subsequent commits are also

22
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,069
recreated. So we have writ
en history as a total befo

23
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,279
e rewriting history is a dest
uctive operation. You shou

24
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:37,649
d do this only with the comm
ts in your local repo

25
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:41,129
itory. Next, I'm going to show
you how to reorder commits.
