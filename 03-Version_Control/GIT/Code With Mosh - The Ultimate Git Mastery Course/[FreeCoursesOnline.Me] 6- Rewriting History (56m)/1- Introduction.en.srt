00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,739
One of the great but also
dangerous features of Git is

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:08,519
that it allows us to rewrite our
history. We can drop or modify

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,849
commits, we can combine or split
them. And so that's what we're

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,369
going to talk about in this
section. We're going to start

5
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:17,849
off by talking about why and
when to rewrite history. Then

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,699
I'm going to show you how to
undo or revert commits. You

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,189
already covered these before,
but we're going to revisit them

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,039
with a bit more depth. Next,
we're going to learn how to use

9
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:29,399
interactive rebasing to rewrite
history. With interactive

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,509
rebasing, we can modify commits,
drop them, combine or split them

11
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,479
and so on. We're also going to
talk about recovering, lost

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,489
commits. There are a lot of fun
things we're going to talk

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,679
about. So let's jump in and get
started.
