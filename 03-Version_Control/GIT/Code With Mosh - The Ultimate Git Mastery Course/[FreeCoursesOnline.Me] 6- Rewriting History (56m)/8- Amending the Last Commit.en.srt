1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,840
There are a lot of cases where
we make a commit. But then we

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,320
realized that we made a mistake,
perhaps we left a typo, or we

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,830
accidentally included a file in
our commit. In these situations,

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,980
we don't really need to make
another commit, we can amend or

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,410
modify the last commit, let me
show you. So let's echo cafes to

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,610
map. txt. Now, let's make a
commit. And say, render cafes on

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,930
the map. Good. Now, let's say we
made a mistake. And we should

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,760
have echoed blue cafes on map
dot txt. So let's open map.txt

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,880
and make the required changes,
blue cafes. Good. Now, back in

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,810
the terminal, first, we need to
a stage the changes. So git add,

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,840
period. Good. Now to amend the
last commit, we type git commit

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:01,140
dash dash MN, we can supply a
new message, or I can just enter

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,920
and accept the previous message.
I'm happy with the message. So

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,360
let's close this back in the
terminal. Our last commit is

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,020
Amanda. Just remember, we didn't
really modify the last commit.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,710
Because as I told you before,
commits and Git are immutable.

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,310
So even though on the surface we
amended the last commit, git

18
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,420
actually created a new commit.
Okay, now, let's look at the

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,310
history. So here's our last
commit. Let's look at the

20
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,530
content of this commit. So git
show head. Take a look. Now w

21
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,270
have blue cafe's. As anothe
example, let's say we forgot t

22
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,480
include a file and the las
commit. How can we do that? Th

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,270
exact same way. So I'm going t
echo hello to file one dot txt

24
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:56,130
Now, let's stage the changes
And amend the last commit. We'r

25
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,000
going to accept the sam
message. So let's move on. Now

26
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,840
Let's look at the history on
more time. Here's our las

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,990
commit, we didn't add a
additional commit. Let's look a

28
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,730
the content of the last commit
So here we have two changes. W

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,900
introduced a new file, file on
dot txt with this content. An

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,060
we added this new line to map
txt. Perfect. Now let's say

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,810
e accidentally included file o
e.txt in the last commit, how c

32
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,200
n we remove it? Well, earlier w
talked about resetting the h

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,740
ad, I talked about three
ifferent options, soft, mixed

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,340
nd hard. I told you that if we
se the mixed option, it is

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,340
oing to unstaged our changes,
ut all of our changes are going

36
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,120
o stay in our working
irectory. So I'm going to reset

37
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,480
he head using the mixed option
o head tilda one now our wor

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,160
ing directory is dirty. So let
s run a short status. We hav

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,370
two changes. We have some mod
fications to map dot txt, and

40
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,690
a new untracked file. Let's say
we don't need file one. So we

41
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,170
an run git clean fd. We talk
d about this earlier in the cour

42
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,470
e. With this we can remove untr
cked files from our working dire

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,400
tory. Alright, so file one is g
ne. And we are left with the

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,740
hanges in map dot txt. So let'
stage two changes, and then

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,920
ake a commit. Here, I'm not g
ing to use them at option becau

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,950
e we've removed the last commi
by resetting the head point

47
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,280
r. So here we should creat
a new commit and say render

48
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,590
cafe's on the map. So this i
how we can amend the last c

49
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,130
mmit. But how can we amend
n earlier commit? We'll talk a

50
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,210
out that next.
