00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,780
Earlier we talked about the
problem with this commit, add a

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,320
reference to Google Map SDK. The
problem with this commit is its

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,990
position in the history, because
we're adding a reference to

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,650
Google Map after implementing a
feature that is dependent on

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,890
google map. So if you check out
this commit, and reinstall our

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,140
pplication to this point, our
pplication is not going to

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,350
ork. Because at this point in
ime, in this snapshot, we don't

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,400
ave a reference to Google Map.
o in this demo, we're going to

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,120
rab this commit and move it
own. It's super easy. So once

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,210
gain, we want to start our
ebase operation. So I'm going

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,660
o grab the ID of this commit,
o we can see all the commits in

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,230
ur rebase script. Git rebase,
ashI. Good. So we can see all of

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,260
our commits from the oldest to
the newest. Now I'm going to gr

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,070
b this command, add a re
erence and move it up. In VS co

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,820
e, we can move a line up by pr
ssing ALT and the up arrow. So

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,920
like this, now this commit is in
the right position. So save th

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,860
changes, close. Rebasing co
pleted successfully. Now le

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,100
's look at the log one more ti
e. So first, we add a re

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,830
erence to Google Map, and th
n we render restaurants on th

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,190
map. This is much better, bu
we're not done yet. In the ne

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,950
t lesson, I'm going to show yo
how to squash a few commits tog

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,460
ther.
