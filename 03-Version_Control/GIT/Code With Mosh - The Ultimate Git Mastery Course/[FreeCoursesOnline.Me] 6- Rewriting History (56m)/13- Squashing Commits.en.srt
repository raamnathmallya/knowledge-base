1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,989
Now look at these three commits,
render restaurants on the map,

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,189
fix a typo, and change the color
of restaurant icons. All these

3
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,939
changes are logically part of
the same unit of work. So

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,849
ideally, we should have
encapsulated all these changes

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,509
inside a single snapshot. But
sometimes that's not possible,

6
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:24,749
because we work incrementally.
And as we learn more about a

7
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:28,379
problem, our solution changes.
So we end up with several

8
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,979
commits that are logically part
of the same unit of work. So

9
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:35,279
let's see how we can combine
these commits together. So

10
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,949
here's the first commit we want
to work on, we're going to start

11
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:41,069
with the parent of this commit,
which is this commit over here.

12
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,909
So copy this, git rebase dash I.
Alright, so here's our first

13
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,719
commit render restaurants on the
map. For the second command, I'm

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,589
going to replace the pig command
with squash. With this, I guess

15
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,189
we'll combine this commit with
the previous commit. Now for the

16
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,739
third commit, once again, we're
going to use the squash command

17
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,159
to combine this commit with the
previous commit, which is the

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,129
combination of these two
commits. Now if the commits that

19
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,129
we want to squash are not
directly next to each other, we

20
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,479
can reorder them first, and then
squash them. So let's save the

21
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,279
changes and close. Now, Git is
suggesting this commit message,

22
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,489
which is the combination of the
messages for all these three

23
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,309
commits. So we have render
restaurants on the map, fix a

24
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:30,269
typo and change the color, I'm
going to discard this commit

25
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:36,179
messages and keep the original
message, save, close. And we're

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,889
done with the rebase operation.
Let's look at our history. Our

27
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:44,219
history is much cleaner. Now, we
have a reference to Google Map

28
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,089
SDK. After that, we render
restaurants on the map, then we

29
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:51,509
update Terms of Service and so
on. Now, we have another command

30
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,679
similar to squash called fix up,
let me show you how it works. So

31
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,009
first, I want to restore our
history to the state before we

32
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,649
started the squash operation. So
we bring up our F log, look what

33
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,129
we have here. The last entry
represents the completion of the

34
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,209
rebase operation. Before that we
had rebase, pick rebase pick

35
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,469
again, followed by a couple of
squashes. And this is where we

36
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,289
started our rebase operation.
Now we want to go to the

37
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:22,739
previous state in history. So
after we finished the previous

38
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,899
rebase operation, so I'm going
to copy this command ID. Now

39
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,169
let's reset the head. Good. So
to verify, let's look at our

40
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:37,499
history one more time, we can
see our original commits, like

41
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:41,069
fix a typo and change the color
of restaurants. Now let's start

42
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,579
the rebase operation one more
time. So I'm going to grab this

43
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,239
coming id

44
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,690
and start an interactive rebase.

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,730
So just like before, we're going
to pick that first commit. But

46
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,000
for the second commit, instead
of squash, I'm going to use fix

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,360
up. Let me use fix up. Git
doesn't take the message of this

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,950
command. So let us fix up for
the third command as well. Same.

49
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,400
Now when I close this, it will
take the message from the first

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,460
commit and apply it to the
commit that combines all these

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,580
three commits, so we don't have
a chance to craft a new message.

52
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,520
Take a look close is
successfully completed rebasing.

53
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,100
Next I'm going to show you how
to split a commit
