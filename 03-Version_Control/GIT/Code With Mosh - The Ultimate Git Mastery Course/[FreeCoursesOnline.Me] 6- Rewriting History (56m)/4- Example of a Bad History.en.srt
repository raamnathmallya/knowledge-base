1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,999
In this section, we're going to
work with a different repository

2
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:09,209
called mercury. If you want to
follow along with me, you can

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,779
get this repository right below
this video. Now, let's look at

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,579
our history. So here's our
initial commands. After that we

5
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,599
have render restaurants, the
map, here, we have a warning

6
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:25,619
issue, that word on is missing.
So the message should have been

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,009
render restaurants on the map.
So later, we'll come back and

8
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:33,719
fix the warning issue. After
that we have fixed a typo. This

9
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,329
is a common issue that I see
quite a lot in people's

10
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,419
repositories. Technically, this
commit shouldn't be here,

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,509
because we shouldn't have made a
typo in the first place. So

12
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,659
comments like this are just
noise in the history. So later,

13
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:48,989
I will show you how to combine
these two commits to make our

14
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,639
history clean and readable. Look
at the next commit, change the

15
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:56,369
color of restaurant icons.
What's the problem with this?

16
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,619
Well, once again, this is part
of the same unit of work. So

17
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,899
ideally, we should combine all
these three commits into a

18
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,189
single logical commit. Next, we
have add a reference to Google

19
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,889
Map SDK, what do you think is
the problem with this commit,

20
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,249
the problem is the position of
this committee in the history

21
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,489
because here we are rendering
the restaurants on Google Map.

22
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:20,189
But then we're adding a
reference to Google Map over

23
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,389
here. So that means, if you
check out this committee on its

24
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:27,449
own, our application is not
going to work. Because at this

25
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:30,779
point in time, we don't have a
reference to Google Map. So here

26
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:34,919
we have two solutions, we should
either move this commit down and

27
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:38,339
put it before rendering
restaurants. Or we can combine

28
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:42,329
these two commits together.
After that we have a work in

29
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,959
progress commit. Again, very
common issue I see all the time.

30
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,079
Commits like this are just
oise in history. And later in

31
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,319
he future, let's say a week or
month from now, if we look at

32
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,069
ur history to see what was
hanged, and why we're not going

33
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:58,379
o extract meaningful
nformation from commits like

34
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,949
his. So we should either drop
his commit or change its

35
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:06,119
essage. Now look at the next
ommit, update Terms of Service

36
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,169
nd Google Map SDK. Here we have
commit that combines two

37
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,349
eparate kinds of changes,
pdating the terms of service

38
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,189
ot nothing to do with updating
oogle Map version. So ideally,

39
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:21,029
e should split this commit into
wo separate commits. Next, we

40
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:24,299
ave another work in progress
ommand, followed by a commit

41
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:28,649
ith a mysterious message. What
his period mean here, nobody

42
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,069
nows. So once again, we should
ither drop this commit or

43
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,649
hange this message. So
hroughout this section, I'm

44
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:37,799
oing to show you various tools
o clean up this history. We're

45
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:40,439
oing to start off by undoing
he last two commits. We'll do

46
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,039
hat next.
