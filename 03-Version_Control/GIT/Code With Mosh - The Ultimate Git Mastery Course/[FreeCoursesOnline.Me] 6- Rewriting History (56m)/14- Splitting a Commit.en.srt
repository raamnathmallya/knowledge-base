1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,050
Now look at this coming up here,
update Terms of Service and

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,740
Google Map SDK version. These
are two completely separate

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,860
changes. Updating the Google Map
version has nothing to do with

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,310
updating Terms of Service. So we
should split this commit into

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,400
two separate commits. So I'm
going to grab this commit ID.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,760
Now we start interactive
rebasing from the parent of this

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,570
commit. All right, here, we're
going to use the Edit command

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,140
that you have seen before. So
when we close this window, it

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,320
will stop the rebase operation
at this commit. Here, we have a

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,220
chance to split this commit into
two separate commits. So close

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,170
back into terminal. Look, we
stopped at this commit, update

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,770
Terms of Service and Google Map
version. Now let's look at the

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,520
log one more time. So head is
currently pointing to this

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,030
commit. And we can use the reset
command to go back to the state

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,470
before we made this commit. So
we can type Git reset, dash die

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,150
soft, had tilda one, or head
carrot, and with this, we go one

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,480
step back before we made this
commit. So our changes are going

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,270
to be in the staging area. and
here we can unstaged some of the

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,470
changes and make a separate
commit. Alternatively, we can go

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,980
two steps back. So we're going
to onstage our changes, but our

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,770
changes are going to be in the
working directory, then we can

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,560
stage and commit them
separately, I'm going to go with

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,500
this. Also, as I told you
before, mixed as the default

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,430
option, so we can simplify this
command to get reset head

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,580
carrot. Okay, now, let's get a
short status. So we have two

26
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,990
kinds of changes. We have some
updates in package dot txt, and

27
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,670
a new on track file. So I'm
going to stage package dot txt

28
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,180
and make a commit. here we can
say update Google Map SDK

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,470
version. We can also say from
1.0 to 2.0.

30
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,400
All right, now let's look at the
history one more time.

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,890
We have divergence. So we
started our rebase operation. At

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,330
this commit, we wanted to replay
these two commits now git

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,330
stopped before replaying this
command. Here, we added a new

34
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,650
commit. And that's why we have
divergence. Now, let's go ahead

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,680
and make another commit for
updating the terms of service.

36
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,400
So we have a new untracked file,
we can add it in the staging

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,470
area, and then make a commit.
Here we can say update or add

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,010
Terms of Service. Good. So we
made another new commit that was

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,160
not part of the history. Let's
look at our log one more time.

40
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,720
So here are the two new commits
that we have created. And this

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,080
is the commit that we're trying
to edit. Note that in this demo,

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,990
I didn't use the amend option,
because I didn't really want to

43
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,740
amend or modify this commit. I
wanted to replace this commit

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,190
with two separate commits. So
now when we continue the rebase

45
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:05,670
operation, it will replay the
next commit. So Git rebase dash

46
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,140
dash continue radom with
rebasing let's pull up the

47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,160
history of one last time. So we
have two separate commits, one

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,680
for updating Google Map, the
other for adding Terms of

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,500
Service. So this is how we can
split the commit
