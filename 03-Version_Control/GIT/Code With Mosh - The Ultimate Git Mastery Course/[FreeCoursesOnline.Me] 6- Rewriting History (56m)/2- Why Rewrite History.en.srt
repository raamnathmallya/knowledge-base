00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,679
Let's start off by talking about
why we need to rewrite history.

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,679
Well, we have to ask, why do we
need the history in the first

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,389
place, we needed to see what was
changed, why, and when, if our

4
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,149
commit messages are not
meaningful, or if our commits

5
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,479
are too large and contain
unrelated changes, or if there

6
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:21,809
are too small and scattered all
over the history, then we're not

7
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:24,239
going to be able to extract
meaningful information from the

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,989
history. We want a clean,
readable history that tells this

9
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,469
story of our project, how it's
evolved from day one. And that's

10
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:34,439
where rewriting the history
comes in. If you have small

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,589
related commits, we can squash
them into a single commit that

12
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:41,489
represents a logical chain set.
On the other hand, if you have a

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,179
large commit that contains a lot
of unrelated changes, we can

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,149
split that commit into a bunch
of smaller commits, each

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,779
representing a logically
separate chain set. We can also

16
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:54,869
reward commit messages so
they're more meaningful. If you

17
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,409
made commits by accident, we can
drop them, we can also modify

18
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,499
the content of our commits. So
if you forgot to include a file

19
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:05,009
in a commit, we can go back and
modify that commit. These are

20
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,099
the operations we can perform
and get to produce a clean,

21
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:11,639
readable and meaningful history.
But rewriting history can be a

22
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,399
dangerous operation, and you
need to know what you're doing

23
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:16,769
before touching the history.
That's what we're going to talk

24
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:17,549
about next.
