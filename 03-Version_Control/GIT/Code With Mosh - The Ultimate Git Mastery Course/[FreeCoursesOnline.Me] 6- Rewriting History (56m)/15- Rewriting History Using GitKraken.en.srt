1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,229
Now let's see how we can rewrite
history using GitKraken. So

2
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:09,929
here's our mercury repository
that we started with at the

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,719
beginning of this section. So
all those bad commits that we

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,439
talked about exist here. Now we
want to start an interactive

5
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:20,519
rebasing from this commit. So we
right click here, and then go to

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,589
interactive rebase. So we see a
similar interface. Here, we can

7
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:30,119
see all the commits listed from
the newest to the oldest. So for

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,559
this commit, we can select
rewording and type the new

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,179
message here. So render
restaurants on the map update

10
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,079
we're done with this, we ca
move commits around. So here's

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,139
the commit that adds a
eference to Google Map, we can

12
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:51,629
elect this and drop it before
endering the restaurant. We can

13
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,319
lso squash commits. So I want t
squash this commit into this c

14
00:00:55,319 --> 00:01:01,199
mmit. So here we pick squash. An
now we can visually see that th

15
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,659
s commit is going to get co
bined with the previous co

16
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,419
mit. Also, I'm going to sq
ash this commit into the pr

17
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:12,629
vious commit. Super easy, we ca
also drop a commit. So for th

18
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,099
s commit I'm going to set the
ommand to drop. Now when you

19
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:19,649
tart the rebase operation, we'r
going to see the same conf

20
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:23,189
ict as before, because in this
commit, we introduced a new file

21
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,429
terms.txt. If it dropped t
is commit, we're essential

22
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,249
y deleting that file. But then
fter this, we have another c

23
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:32,789
mmit that tries to update th
t file. So let's go ahead and

24
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,809
start the rebase operation
Alright, we have a conflict.

25
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:40,229
n the right side, you can see we
have a conflict in terms of t

26
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,639
t. So let's select this. Here
on the top, we have a few option

27
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:48,359
. We can keep the modified v
rsion or delete the file. In t

28
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,689
is case, we're going to keep th
modified version. So let's go w

29
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,069
th that and then continue r
basing. Good, so we're done

30
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:58,919
with rebasing that was super
asy, but here we cannot edi

31
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,589
a commit, so we cannot spl
t it into two separate c

32
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:05,309
mmits or amended. For those case
, you have to go back to the ter

33
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:05,969
inal.
