00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
As we commit to our branches, we
need to know how they're

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,180
diverging from master. So in
this video, I'm going to show

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,120
you a couple of different ways
to compare branches. So

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,180
currently we are on master. At
some point in the future, we're

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,270
going to merge the bug fix
branch into master. But before

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,840
doing so, you want to know what
commits are coming in master. So

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,540
we type git log Master, colon,
colon, bug fix slash signup

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,710
form. So this means show me all
the commits that are in bug fix

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,970
branch, and are not in master.
Currently, we have only a single

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,670
commit, if you had more commits,
all of them would be listed

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,120
here. And just like before, we
can use the one line option to

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,880
make the output more concise.
Now, what if you want to see the

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,080
actual changes and not the list
of commits? Well, what tool do

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,730
we use for seeing the changes?
diff. So git diff, we're going

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,810
to compare master with the bug
fix scratch. So we type master

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,630
colon colon bug fix slash signup
form. So now we know that once

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,410
we merge the bug fix branch into
master in audience dot txt,

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,350
e're going to have these
hanges. So these two lines are

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,230
oing to get removed and
eplaced with these two lines.

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,680
here's a shorter way to write
his command. Because we're

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,490
urrently on Master, we don't
ave to type master dot dot

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,340
ere. So we can type get def bug
ix slash sign up for. So this

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,890
hows the differences between
his branch and the current

24
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,920
ranch, which is master. Now
ometimes, we don't want to see

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,890
he changes in terms of the
ode. We just want to know what

26
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,890
iles are going to be affected.
n those cases, we can use one

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,190
f the options we talked about
n the previous section, name

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,650
nly, or name status. So once we
erge the bug fix branch into

29
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,130
aster audience, that txt is
oing to be modified.
