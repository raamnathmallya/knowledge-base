1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,730
So what is branching all about?
Well, branching allows us to

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,640
diverge from the main line of
work and work on something else

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,060
in isolation. Conceptually, you
can think of a branch like a

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,660
separate, isolated workspace. So
we have our main workspace,

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,780
which is called Master, we can
have another workspace, we're

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,540
working on a new feature in
isolation. While we're

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,230
developing this new feature, our
code may get unstable. So we

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,020
don't want to release the code
in this workspace. We continue

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,380
working here, when we're done,
we test our code. And after we

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,680
fix all the bugs, then we bring
the changes in this workspace

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,550
into the master. This is called
merging. So branching allows us

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,730
to work on different work items.
without messing up with the main

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,180
line of work, we keep the main
line as stable as possible, so

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,690
we can release it anytime. Also,
anyone joining our team can

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,930
start off on a stable codebase.
That's the idea of branching.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,470
Now, the way git manages
branches is very different from

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,800
many other version control
systems like subversion. In

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,550
subversion, when we create a new
branch, subversion takes a copy

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,520
of our entire working directory
and stores it somewhere else.

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,950
What if you have hundreds or
thousands of files in our

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,220
project, all these files have to
be copied. And this operation

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,400
can take a little while. That's
why a lot of subversion users

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,490
hate branching, because it's
slow and can waste a lot of disk

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,180
space. Git branches are super
fast and cheap, because a branch

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,930
and Git is just a pointer to a
commit. So the master branch is

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,050
just a pointer to the last
commit in the main line of work.

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,410
As we make new commits, get most
this pointer forward

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,860
automatically. So it knows what
is the latest code in the main

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,010
line of work. That is the
snapshot stores in this commit.

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,580
When we create a new branch, git
creates a new pointer that can

31
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,480
be moved around. This pointer is
just a tiny file that contains a

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,290
40 byte commit ID. That's why
creating a branch in Git is

33
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,500
blazingly fast. Now when we
switch to this branch and make

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,100
new commits get most of this
point forward, the master

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,430
pointer stays where it is, so
git knows the latest code in

36
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,480
each branch. Let me switch back
to master. It takes the snapshot

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,810
from the commit that master
points to and resets our working

38
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,350
directory to that snapshot. So
we always have a single working

39
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,530
directory. Now how does git know
which branch we're currently

40
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,760
working on using a special
pointer called head. This coiner

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,520
is also another type of file
that contains the name of a

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,640
branch like master. Let me
switch to a different branch.

43
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,360
Git moves the head pointer out.
o it updates a tiny file and

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,180
rites the name of the target
ranch. This is how we can track

45
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,640
hat branch we're currently
orking on. And throughout the

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,980
ection. You're gonna learn
verything you need to know to

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,970
ork with branches.
