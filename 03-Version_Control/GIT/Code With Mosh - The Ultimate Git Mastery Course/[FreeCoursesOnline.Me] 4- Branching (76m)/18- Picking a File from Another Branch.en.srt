1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,540
So you'll learn how to cherry
pick a particular commit from

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,660
another branch and apply it to
the current branch. But what if

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,450
you're only interested in a
single file, not a whole commit,

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,120
let me show you how to bring a
given file from another branch

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,450
into the current branch. So for
this demo, I'm going to create

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,490
another branch called feature
slash send email. That is

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,590
scratch, I'm going to make a
change to our table of content

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,640
file. So echo, river to table of
content dot txt. Now, let's make

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,810
a comment, and say update table
of content. Now let's say we

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,030
want to bring this table of
content file to our master

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,860
branch. So first, we switch to
master. Now we're going to use

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,110
the Restore command. You'll
learn about this earlier in the

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,120
course. So we type Git restore,
dash di source, or we could use

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,830
dash s for short. We set this to
our target branch, feature slash

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
send email. And then we specify
our file name. In this case,

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,490
table of contents. txt, the
earlier I told you that

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,460
sometimes get cannot interpret
the file name. So in those

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,970
situations, we have to add
double hyphens here to separate

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,870
the options from the file or the
files here. Now when I run this

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,260
command, Git is going to restore
our table of content file in our

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,440
working directory. From the
latest version of this file

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,370
stored in this branch. Take a
look. So our working directory

23
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,750
is dirty. Let's get a short
status. So we have some local

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,990
changes in this file, we can
view the contents of this file

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,390
using the cat command. So cat
table of content, that txt. So

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,760
this is the change that we
applied in our feature branch.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,850
Now we can stage the change and
committed in the current branch.
