00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,899
In this section I'm going to
talk about one of the most

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,499
important and powerful features
of Git called branching. You

3
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:10,379
will learn how to use branches
to diverged from the main line

4
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,829
of development and work on
something else in isolation, how

5
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:17,009
to compare branches to see their
differences, how to merge them.

6
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:19,529
We'll talk about different
merging techniques like three

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,219
way merging, fast forwarding,
squash merging and rebasing.

8
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:26,579
We'll also talk about resolving
merge conflicts, undoing a

9
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,279
faulty merge, and using
essential tools like stashing

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,559
and cherry picking. The skills
you're going to learn in this

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,889
section can totally change the
way you develop software. So

12
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,329
let's jump in and get started.
