1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,349
Let's see how we can work with
branches and GitKraken. So as yo

2
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:09,959
can see, here, we have a be
utiful graph of our branches. An

3
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:12,839
we can easily see all the br
nches we have created and wh

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,989
ther these branches have been me
ged into master or not. For ex

5
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:19,859
mple, this feature branch, re
et password has a single co

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,939
mit, and it hasn't been me
ged into master. In contrast, we

7
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:27,599
have this other branch here, bu
fix slash Change Password. Ea

8
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,589
lier, we created this branch fr
m this commit on Master, we ad

9
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,769
ed one commit to this branch, an
then merge it into master. So

10
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,129
here's our merge commit. Now le
's create a new branch from Ma

11
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,849
ter. So master is the current br
nch, we can also change the cu

12
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:45,959
rent branch from this drop do
n list over here. Now, we ri

13
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:49,979
ht click here, and go to cr
ate branch here. Let's give it

14
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,749
a name, like feature slash de
ete user. So now we are on th

15
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:59,009
s new branch, we can right cl
ck it and rename or deleted. No

16
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,399
let's go to VS code, make so
e changes and add a commit to th

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,059
s branch. So in our table of co
tent file, I'm going to add tw

18
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:11,699
lines, green tea save, GitKrak
n has detected our change

19
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:15,329
. So let's look at them. Here's
the file that we have modifi

20
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,439
d, let's state the change
and make a comment. We can sa

21
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,889
update table of content. Good.
o our branch pointer move forwar

22
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,799
. Now we have one extra commit
here that is not in master

23
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,579
Next, I'm going to switch
back to master and make a confli

24
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,009
ting change. So double click
aster. Here in table of conten

25
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:44,189
, I'm going to say black tea. O
ay. GitKraken has detected

26
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,229
ur change. So let's go ahead and
make another commit. Good. So

27
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,429
ook, our branches have diverged.
Master is here, our feature b

28
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,819
anches over here, and we can se
the divergence. Now before do

29
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,999
ng a merge, let's compare t
ese branches. So currently

30
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:05,609
the last commit on our featu
e branch is selected, I'm going

31
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,719
to hold down the Shift and selec
the master branch. Now the t

32
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,229
ps of these branches have been
selected. So we can see their

33
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,929
diff over here, the only file
that has been changed across th

34
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:20,039
se two branches is our table of
ontent file. So take a look. Obv

35
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,919
ously, we have a conflict
nd change on line three. So

36
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,619
when we do a merge, we're goi
g to run into conflict.

37
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:31,559
Now let's close this. And to em
rge. So master is the current b

38
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:36,089
anch, we right click on our fe
ture branch. and here we can do

39
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:40,649
a rebase or a merge. Let's go
ith merge, our merge failed. A

40
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:43,559
d on the right side, we can se
merge conflicts detected.

41
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:47,999
so here we can see all the confl
ct files. Let's select table of

42
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:51,059
ontent, I love this merge too
built into GitKraken. So

43
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:55,709
on the left side, we have chan
es on master. And on the right

44
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,779
side, we have changes on o
r feature branch. Now down bel

45
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,919
w, we can see the output. So w
can go ahead and select the c

46
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,129
anges in Master, followed by
hanges in our feature bran

47
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,879
h. If this is not what we want
we can always deselect one

48
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,709
or more of these lines, or ch
nge the order. If you have mor

49
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,379
than one conflict, we can brows
through them over here. Very s

50
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,299
mple. When we're done, we cli
k Save. Our table of content f

51
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,929
le is now staged. And here's t
e default commit message merg

52
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:28,679
branch feature slash delete
user. Here we can abort the ma

53
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:32,339
riage or committed. Let's go ahe
d with that. So here's our m

54
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:35,189
rge commit beautiful. N
w let's say we screwed some

55
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,279
hing up. So we're going to und
this merge, we can either rever

56
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:42,449
it, or reset the head to the
revious commit. So with this co

57
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,979
mit selected, we can right cl
ck and go to revert commit, GitK

58
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,759
aken and saying Do you want to
mmediately commit the reve

59
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,289
ted changes? Yes. So here's
he revert of our merge commit. A

60
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:59,159
ternatively, we can reset the h
ad to the commit before our merg

61
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,819
commit. So here's our merg
commit. And here's the last

62
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,999
commit on master. We can
ight click this commit and go t

63
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:10,709
reset master to this commit. He
e we have three options you hav

64
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,769
seen before. Soft, mixed and
hard. We're gonna go with h

65
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,299
rd. Good so our merge commit is
now gone. So this was the es

66
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,059
ence of working with branches a
d GitKraken. As you can see, Gi

67
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,239
Kraken it makes it incredibly e
sy to manage branches and r

68
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,249
solve conflicts.
