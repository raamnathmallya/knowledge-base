1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,260
Now let's look at an example of
a three way merge. First, let's

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,460
look at our history. So this is
where we are, our master branch

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,090
is at this commit, which is a
merge commit. Now I'm going to

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,570
create a new branch for
implementing a new feature. So

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,700
get switch, dash C for create,
we're going to call that branch

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,380
feature slash, Change Password.
So now we have this new branch.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,110
Let's look at our history one
more time. So at this point,

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,730
both these pointers are Change
Password pointer and master

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,180
pointer are pointing to the same
commit. Now, what you want to

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,260
explore in this lesson is how
two branches can diverge. So

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,470
we're currently on the Change
Password branch. Let's make a

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,910
commit here, I'm going to echo
hello to, let's say change as

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,950
password to txt. Now we're going
to save the changes and commit

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,270
them and say, build the Change
Password form.

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,170
Now, let's look at our history
again.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,580
So as you can see, our Change
Password branch is one commit

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,060
ahead of the master branch,
right? But our branches have not

18
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,600
diverged yet, because there is a
direct linear path from the

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,780
Change Password branch to
master. So to make this branches

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,750
diverged, I'm going to go back
to master and make a new commit.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,910
So Git switch Master, let's open
objectives dot txt, and make a

22
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,180
small change here, it doesn't
really matter. Now, back into

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,610
terminal, let's run git add, and
then commit and say, update

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,440
objectives. txt. So now both the
master and Change Password

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,720
branches have a new commit, take
a look. So git log. Okay, here's

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,860
master. And here's the Change
Password branch. As we can see,

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,400
our branches have diverged. And
this is the commit where we

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,760
started the Change Password
branch, we added a new commit in

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,420
this branch and got back to
master and added a new commit to

30
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,410
master. Now we do not have a
direct linear path from change

31
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,100
password to master. So if we
start from here, we cannot go to

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,640
master. So when we try to merge
the changes, Git is going to run

33
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,340
a three way merge, it's going to
look at the tips of this

34
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,510
branches, which is this commit.
And this commit over here, is

35
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,020
going to compare these with our
common ancestor, which is in

36
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,620
this case, this commit over
here, based on the differences,

37
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,890
it's going to figure out how to
merge or combine the changes

38
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,200
into a new merge commit. So here
on the master branch, we type

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,310
Git merge, feature slash change
password. Once again, we have a

40
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,220
default message for the merge
commit, we can accept it as is

41
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,570
or change it if we need to. So
let's close this window. Now

42
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,540
back in the terminal, as you can
see, we don't have a fast

43
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,570
forward merge. Now let's look at
our history one more time.

44
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,510
So here's the result of the
merge. Our Change

45
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,490
Password branch is pointing at
this commit.

46
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:12,929
Our Master was here. Now we
combine these two into a new

47
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:13,919
merge commit over here.
