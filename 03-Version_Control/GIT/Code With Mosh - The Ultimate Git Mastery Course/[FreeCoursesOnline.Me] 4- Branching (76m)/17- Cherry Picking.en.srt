1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,350
Here we have a feature branch
with two commits, f1, and f2.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,740
Now, let's see one of these
commits, like f1 has some

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,770
interesting changes we want to
have in master. But we're not

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,400
quite ready to merge our feature
branch into master. What should

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,790
we do now, this is where we use
cherry picking. So we can cherry

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,780
pick this particular commit, and
apply it on top of master. Let

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,780
me show you how to do this. Here
in our history, you can see that

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,290
our feature branch, it's one
commit ahead of master. Now

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,930
we're going to bring this
particular commit into master

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,000
without merging. So I'm going to
copy this commit ID. Now we're

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,400
currently on Master, we type Git
cherry, dash pig, either type

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,240
the commit ID, here we have a
conflict in table of contents of

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,550
txt. So let's open up our merge
tool. In this demo, I'm going to

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,550
take the changes in the remote
branch, which is our feature

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,320
branch. So I'm going to select
this purple icon. Good, save the

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,550
changes, close the merge tool.
We're back here. As we can see,

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,070
in the terminal window, we're in
the middle of a cherry pick.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,720
Let's have a quick look at our
staging area. So our table of

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,710
contents file has some changes
that are in the staging area. We

20
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,830
also have this directory here,
DS on the land store, don't

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,770
worry about it. This is only for
Mac computers. This is one of

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,230
those standard directories that
we need to include in our Git

23
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,310
ignore file. For now, let's not
worry about it. So let's make a

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,390
commit. I'm gonna specify a
message. The default message

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,450
that we have here is based on
the commit that you were trying

26
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,570
to cherry pick, so we can accept
it or change it if necessary.

27
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,180
Now close back in the terminal.
Let's look at our history one

28
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,560
more time. So master has moved
forward. And now we have this

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,230
new commit that we cherry picked
from our feature branch.
