1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,869
Let's say we just got a bug
report. Now to fix this bug,

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,199
first, we should create a new
branch called bug fix. So we

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,999
type git branch bug fix. Now to
see the list of branches, we

4
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:19,079
type git branch. So currently,
we have two branches, bug fix,

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,399
and master. There is an asterisk
before Master, which means we're

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,699
currently on the master branch.
You can also see that over here,

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,579
as I told you earlier in the
course, this is coming from Zed

8
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,169
sh, or Z shell with Git plugin.
So if you're on Mac, to see

9
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:37,379
something like this, you should
install set sh with Git plugin.

10
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,769
If you're on Windows, you should
install posh Git. This is really

11
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,529
helpful because here we can
clearly see what is the current

12
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:46,529
branch. One of the issues that a
lot of people face is they

13
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:50,099
accidentally commit their code
to the wrong branch. So we're

14
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,799
currently on the master branch.
There's another way to know the

15
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,289
current branch, we can type git
status on branch master. Now, to

16
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,139
fix this imaginary bug. First,
we have to change the current

17
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:05,969
branch to bug fix. There are two
ways to do this. In the past, we

18
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,489
used the checkout command. But
this command had multiple

19
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,789
applications, a lot of people
found it confusing. So these

20
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:15,479
days, we have a new command for
switching branches. So get

21
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,059
switch, bug fix. Now here on the
bug fix branch beautiful. But

22
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,999
before going forward, I want to
rename this branch, it's not

23
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,909
clear what bug we're trying to
fix here. And also in the

24
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,519
future, it's very likely that
we're going to have 10s or

25
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,669
hundreds of other bugs to fix.
So it's better to use a more

26
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:36,209
specific name. To rename this
branch, we can type git branch

27
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,559
dash m, we type the old name,
and then the new name, we can

28
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:45,869
use a convention like bug fix
slash signup form, assuming that

29
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,229
this bug is in our signup form.
If you don't like it forward

30
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,019
slash, you can use a hyphen
here. That's a matter of

31
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,949
personal preference. Okay, now
we can see our branches renamed

32
00:01:55,949 --> 00:02:00,269
beautiful. So to make some
changes, let's open audience dot

33
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,309
txt in VS code or your favorite
code editor. Right here, I'm

34
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,739
going to make a few changes.
First, I'm going to rename

35
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,419
audience to who this course is
for and then I'm going to add a

36
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:17,639
border. And finally, I'm going
to remove the slide. So we have

37
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,939
three kinds of changes here.
addition, modification, and

38
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,509
deletion. Okay? Obviously, these
changes have nothing to do with

39
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:27,239
fixing a bug on a signup form.
But here, we're not working on

40
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,179
an application. So don't worry
about the differences. I'm just

41
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,939
teaching you how to use various
tools and get the name of our

42
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,669
branches, the changes we'll make
and the commit messages don't

43
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:40,049
matter. Now save the changes.
Back in the terminal. Our

44
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,659
working directory is dirty, as
we can see from the yellow

45
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,009
marker. So as from status, we
can clearly see that you've

46
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:51,119
modified this file and this file
is not staged. So let's add it

47
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:55,499
to the staging area. And then
committed, we can say fix the

48
00:02:55,499 --> 00:03:00,239
bug that prevented the users
from signing up.

49
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,740
Good. Now let's look at our log.
So git log, one line, see what's

50
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,000
going on here. On the top, we
have head pointing to the bug

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,760
fix branch. That means we're
currently on the bug fix branch.

52
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,480
And here's the latest commit and
the bug fix branch. Now below

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,240
that, we can see our master
branch, which is just a pointer

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,350
to a commit. So as we can see,
our master branch is one commit

55
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,650
behind the bug fix branch. At
some point in the future, we're

56
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,260
going to merge the bug fix
branch with the master branch to

57
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,290
bring the master branch up. But
don't worry about it. Now, let's

58
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,850
just focus on managing branches.
So in audience dot txt, we made

59
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,450
a few changes. And these changes
are only visible in the book fix

60
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,190
scratch. So if we switch back to
the master branch, and open

61
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,820
audience dot txt, we see the old
version of this file. So

62
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,760
branches allow us to work on
different tasks in isolation,

63
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,610
the code we have in these
branches are isolated, at some

64
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,060
point, we will merge them to
bring them together. Now while

65
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,050
we're on the master branch, if
we look at our log, on the top,

66
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,050
we can see head is pointing to
the master branch. But we don't

67
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,470
see the bug fix branch, because
bug fix is ahead of the master

68
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,250
branch. So its commits are not
listed here by default. To view

69
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,320
the commits across all branches,
we use the all option. Now, even

70
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,720
though we are on the master
branch, we can see the commits

71
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,650
in other branches, in this case,
the bug fix branch. Now at some

72
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,230
point in the future, when we are
done with the bug fix branch,

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,710
when we merge it into the master
branch, we need to delete it. So

74
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:39,870
we type git branch dash D, bug
fix slash sign up for the here

75
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,320
we get an error saying the
branch bug fix is not fully

76
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,350
merged. You're seeing this error
because we have some changes in

77
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,530
the bug fix branch that are not
merged with a master branch. So

78
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,800
by default, it prevents us from
accidentally deleting the sprach

79
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,160
unless we merge it first. But if
you're pretty sure that we don't

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,220
want the changes in this branch,
we can force the deletion by

81
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,250
using a capital So we say git
branch dash, capital D. In this

82
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,590
video, I'm not going to delete
this branch because later in the

83
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,960
section, we're going to merge
the changes in this branch with

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,470
Master
