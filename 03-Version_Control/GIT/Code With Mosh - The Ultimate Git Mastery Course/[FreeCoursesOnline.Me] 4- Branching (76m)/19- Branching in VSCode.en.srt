1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,839
Let's see how we can work with
branches in VS code. As I told

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,209
you in the previous section, we
VS code has limited good

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,269
features. So to bring additional
features, we have to install an

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,419
extension called git lens. If
ou missed that video in the

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,169
revious section, go to the
xtensions panel and search for

6
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,989
uidelines. This is the
xtension we're going to use to

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:26,699
ork with branches. So once you
nstall this, you're going to

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,209
ee this new icon over here.
ere's our Venus repository.

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,289
ver here we have this folder
alled branches, we can see all

10
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,409
f our branches here. So master
s our current branch, as

11
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,849
ndicated by this tick icon.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,580
We also have these folders, bug
fix,

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,970
and feature. And the reason we
have these folders is because I

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,350
used a forward slash in naming
this branches. So bug fix slash,

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,190
whatever. That is the benefit of
using this convention. Here, we

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,430
can change the layout. So
instead of a tree structure, we

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,240
can view our branches in a list.
So we click on this icon, all of

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,270
our branches are listed here.
And in front of each branch, we

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,480
can see the last time this
branch was updated. So as a best

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,120
practice, if you're done with a
branch, make sure to delete it.

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,490
Otherwise, all these branches
hanging there, it's just going

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,220
to create confusion for you. Now
we can expand any of these

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,610
branches to look at its history.
Unfortunately, at the time of

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,430
recording this lesson, we cannot
see all of our branches in the

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,310
graph. To do that, we're going
to use another extension, which

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,140
I'm going to talk about at the
end of this lesson.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,870
So master is the current branch.

28
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,349
Now I'm going to create a new
branch based on the last commit

29
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,219
on master. So we right click
here. And here we have a few

30
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,369
options, we can switch to this
branch, whichever and in this

31
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,069
branch, create a new branch and
create attack.

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,560
So let's create a new branch.
I'm going

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,060
to call this feature slash reset
that password. Now we get this

34
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,330
error saying this is not a valid
branch name. I don't know what

35
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,810
this is coming up, don't worry
about it, just press enter. Here

36
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,500
we have a few options, we can
create this branch, or we can

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,160
create this branch and switch to
it. Or we can cancel, I'm going

38
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,520
to go with the second option.
Good. So we're currently on our

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,450
feature branch, we can also see
the current branch over here in

40
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,620
the status bar. Now let's make a
new commit in this branch. So

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,260
I'm going to Open Table of
Contents. txt

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,890
and say, beautiful weather,

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,540
save the changes. Now we go to
the source control panel,

44
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,870
unfortunately, we got is not
picking up our change.

45
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,430
So we have to

46
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,270
refresh the view.

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,570
Good. So here's the change.
Let's give this committee a

48
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,830
message, we can say, right,
beautiful weather to table of

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,280
content.

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,330
Now, we make a comment. Good. So

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,210
let's go to git lens.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,550
Here in our branches,

53
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,580
we can see this new commit over
here.

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,450
Now after a while, as we make
new commits, we want to compare

55
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,060
this branch with Master to see
how these branches have

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,410
diverged. So with our feature
branch selected, here, we can

57
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,160
click on compare. And in this
drop down list, we can see all

58
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,810
of our branches. So I'm going to
select master. To see how this

59
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,950
branch is different from Master.
Let's expand this folder. So

60
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,380
currently we have one commit.
And this commit is in our

61
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,620
feature branch. in a real
situation, we could have several

62
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,440
commits here. Some of these
commits are on Master, the

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,320
others are on the feature
branch, we can also see the

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,680
summary of files that are
changed. So in this example, our

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,500
table of content file has
changed, we can click on it

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,880
to see the exact lines of code
that have changed. In this case,

67
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,730
we have this new line in our
feature branch. So after

68
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,790
immerses branch into Master,
this new line is going to be

69
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,390
added to table of content in
master. Now I want to go back to

70
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,620
master and make a conflicting
change. So we can click on this

71
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,930
branch on the status bar and go
to master wellness Open Table of

72
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,460
Contents. And read something
else here like sunny day, save

73
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,420
the changes. Now if we go to
source control panel, once

74
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,460
again, we have to refresh the
view. I don't know what's going

75
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,130
on here, let's say write,
Sunday, the table of contents.

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,210
So you haven't you come in here
and now we want to do a merge.

77
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,900
So we get to git lens. We're
urrently on master.

78
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,450
Now want to merge our feature
branch into master.

79
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,190
So we right click on our branch
and select merge branch into

80
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,850
current which is Master, we can
also do a rebase. Either way,

81
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,200
we're going to end up with a
conflict.

82
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,900
In this demo, I'm going to go
with merge branch.

83
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,960
Here we have a few options, we

84
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,100
can just do a default merge. So
that is equivalent to executing

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,110
Git merge target branch. We have
another option here. Fast

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,480
forward merge. So look at this
option dash f f dash only with

87
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,750
this, we're telling it Hey, to
merge only fast forward is

88
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,380
possible. Otherwise don't do a
merge. We have another option

89
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,620
here. No Fast Forward merge. We
talked about This earlier in

90
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,380
this section, if you select
this, it is going to create a

91
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,830
merge commit, even if fast
forward is an option, you also

92
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,410
have squash merge. Now in this
demo, I'm going to go with the

93
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,630
default patch. So look in the
terminal window, you got a

94
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,430
conflict, a conflict in our
table of content file. So on the

95
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,760
left,

96
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,360
we go to our source control
panel.

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,970
Let's refresh the view one more
time.

98
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,770
So under merge changes, we can
see all conflicted files. So

99
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,300
here we have a C, which means
conflict. If you open this, we

100
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,570
can see the conflict markers. So
we can manually edit this file

101
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,930
or use one of these options over
here. In this case, I'm going to

102
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,240
accept those changes and save.
Now, we need to commit the

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,020
changes. So first, we need to
stage them. So we click on this

104
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,470
icon.

105
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,350
Now this file is in the staging
area.

106
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,500
And here we have the default
commit message. Well,

107
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
let's make a commit. Good.

108
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,140
So I can get Lance.

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,590
Here's our master branch. And
here's our merge commit. Now,

110
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,770
let's say we screwed something
up, we have a faulty merge, so

111
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,920
we cannot compile our code, or
application doesn't work, you

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,040
want to undo this merge. What
should we do here? Well, let's

113
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,100
read click this, we can revert
this commit. So it's gonna

114
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,340
create a new commit that will
undo the changes in this commit.

115
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,790
Unfortunately, at the time of
recording this, this option

116
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,750
doesn't work. So if you select
this, and go ahead with

117
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,980
reverting this commit, and we
get this error in the terminal

118
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,970
saying, dash m option was not
given. We talked about this

119
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,580
earlier in the section. So
because a merge commit has two

120
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,550
parents, and we have to specify
the parent number in order to

121
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,170
revert this commit. So for this
demo, I'm going to undo our

122
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,890
merge commit. So back in Git
lens, here's our merge commit,

123
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,760
e want to reset the head to the
revious commit over here. So if

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,010
e right click on this and
elect

125
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,270
reset to commit,

126
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,290
here we have a few options, we
can do a soft reset or hard

127
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,370
reset. A soft reset only updates
the head pointer. But a hard

128
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,640
reset also updates the staging
area and the working directory

129
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,390
to match the snapshot pointed to
the latest commit. So here we're

130
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,170
going to go with hard reset.
Good. Now our merge commit is

131
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,470
gone.

132
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,410
here and git lens, we also h
ve

133
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,320
our stashes. Currently, we don't
have any stashes.

134
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,520
So I can go to our table of
content file and make some

135
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,670
changes. Now over here, we can
stash all the local changes. So

136
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,450
let's select that. Here we
supply a message and let's say

137
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:46,230
new tax rolls, enter. So we have
a new stash. Here we can see a

138
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,260
summary of the changes. So we
have zero new files, one

139
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,860
modified file and zero deleted
files. That some point in the

140
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,020
future, we're going to apply
this stash to our working

141
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,760
directory. So we can click on
this icon, apply a stash. Here

142
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,600
we have a few options, we can
apply to stash, or we can pop

143
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,420
this stash. This is going to
apply this stash and then drop

144
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,950
it or we can cancel. So I'm
going to apply the stash. Okay,

145
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,210
our changes are back. And we can
still see the stash here. When

146
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:15,690
we were done,

147
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,940
we can delete it very easily.

148
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,390
So these are some of the
features we have in kidlat. I

149
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,630
told you that good lens doesn't
provide a graph of our branches.

150
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,600
To see a graph, we should
install an extension called get

151
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,050
graph.

152
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,510
So here in the extensions panel,

153
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,040
get graph.

154
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,050
It's right here.

155
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,480
This gives us a beautiful graph
of our branches. So once you

156
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,200
install this

157
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:42,809
here in the source control
panel,

158
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,089
you're going to see a new icon

159
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,260
called get graph.

160
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,550
And now we can clearly see a
graph of our branches. For

161
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,460
example, here we have this
branch feature reset password

162
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,850
that is not merge into master.
So we have this commit that is

163
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,230
not included in master down
below. You can see earlier we

164
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,320
created this branch and then
later we merge it into master
