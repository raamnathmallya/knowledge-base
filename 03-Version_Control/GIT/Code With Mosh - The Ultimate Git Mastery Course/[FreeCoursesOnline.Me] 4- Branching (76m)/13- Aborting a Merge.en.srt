00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,570
So you'll learn that when doing
a merge, you may run into one or

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,510
more conflicts. Now what if
you're not quite ready to handle

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,810
these conflicts, perhaps we have
several conflicts and we're in

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,510
the middle of something. So we
don't have enough time to spend

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,990
on resolving this conflict. And
in situations like this, we can

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,710
easily go back to the state
before we started the merge. So

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,740
here we have a merge conflict.
to abort the merge. We simply

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,630
type Git merge, dash dash abort.
Now we're back to the state

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,110
before we started the merge. So
if we resolve some conflicts and

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,470
stage the changes, those
resolutions are gone. We're back

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,600
to a clean state before we start
at the me
