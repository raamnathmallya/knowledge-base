1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,080
Quite frankly, yes, good is not
the best tool for resolving

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,810
conflicts, at least not at the
time of recording this lesson.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,750
So let's look at some other
tools for resolving conflicts.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,140
There's so many tools out there.
The most popular ones are K,

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,740
diff, and P4merge, which are
cross platform, and winmerge,

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,850
which is for Windows only. If
you use GetKraken, or a powerful

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,210
Id like IntelliJ, you don't need
any of this external merge

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,820
tools. But they still encourage
you to watch this lesson to the

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,430
end, because the skills you're
going to learn will transfer to

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,010
other tools. In this lesson,
we're going to use p for merge

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,880
for resolving conflicts. So open
up your browser and search for

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,980
P4merge. Over here on
P4merge.com. You can download

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,210
the latest version. Let's go
with this. Here, you have to

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,660
select your operating system,
I'm going to go with Mac and

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,860
download the latest version. We
don't have to register. So let's

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,950
skip registration. Good. All
right, so we get a dmg file on

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,580
Mac. If you're on Windows,
you'll get a setup wizard. So

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,750
let's drag and drop before merge
onto applications. It seemed

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,820
that I already have this, so I'm
going to replace it with the

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,410
latest version. Good. Now here
in the terminal, we have to

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,520
configure P4merge as our default
merge tool. So we say Git

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,730
config, dash dash global merge
tool, we give it a name, P4merge

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,290
next we need to tell Git where
to find p for merge. So once

24
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,620
again, git config, dash dash
global merge tool dot P4merge,

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,050
that is the name we assigned
over here, dot path. Here in

26
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,500
double quotes, we should add the
full path to P4merge. If you're

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,800
on Windows, your path is going
to be like C colon, backslash

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,640
Program Files, backslas p for
P4merge, backslash, whatever,

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,240
depending on where you have
installed this. On Mac, the path

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,670
is going to be slash
applications, slash P4merge that

31
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:10,530
app slash contents slash Mac OS
slash P4merge make sure to spell

32
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,130
it properly, exactly as what you
see here. All the uppercase and

33
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,340
lowercase letters are different
because Mac OS is a case

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,210
sensitive operating system.
Okay, so we have configured our

35
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,690
default merge tool. Now we need
a merge conflict. To save time,

36
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,540
I'm not going to recreate
another merge conflict, I'm

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,830
going to simulate the previous
conflict. So we're on master.

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,940
And we want to merge this with
our bug fix branch. So Git

39
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,920
merge, bug fix slash Change
Password. Alright, we got to

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,280
merge conflicts exactly like
before. In the previous lesson,

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,200
we open change password in VS
code to edit the conflict here.

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,880
Now this time, we're going to
use our external merge tool. So

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,610
if we run git merge, so right
here, we have three copies of

44
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,760
our change password file. On the
left side, we have changed

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,000
password on the left remote.
This is the version we have in

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,660
our remote or target branch,
which is our bug fix branch. In

47
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,660
the middle, we have Change
Password underline base, this is

48
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,900
the base copy the base version.
So here's the version of this

49
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,380
file before our branches
diverged. And on the right side,

50
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,020
we have changed password
underlined local. So this

51
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,690
represents the changes we have
in the current branch, which is

52
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,870
the master branch. Now the
beauty of this tool is that here

53
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,110
we can visually see the
conflicting changes. So I like

54
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,770
VS code where we had those ugly
Git markers. Here, we can easily

55
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,820
see that on the second line, we
have a conflict and change. Now

56
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,490
down below, we can see how these
changes are going to get

57
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,480
combined. So by default, P4mer
e is bringing changes from bot

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,380
branches. But we can easily cha
ge this. So on the right sid

59
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,070
, we have two icons, purple and
green, and purple represents the

60
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,490
changes on the left side. So loo
at the legend over here, you

61
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,910
have a purple icon that rep
esents the left side, that cha

62
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,060
ges in the remote branch. The
green icon represents the cha

63
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,930
ges in the local branch, whi
h is master. So if we click on

64
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,770
he purple icon, now we only hav
the changes in the local bra

65
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,100
ch. Now while green is sel
cted, we can select the oth

66
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,630
r branch by holding down shi
t and clicking. So now we hav

67
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,720
the changes in both these bra
ches. This is the idea of P4mer

68
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,620
e or visual merge tools. Pretty
uch all merge tools out there w

69
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,400
rk in a similar fashion. If you
ave multiple conflicts in the

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,460
ame file, we can browse through
them using these buttons on the

71
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,060
oolbar. So we resolve the con
lict. When we are done. Just li

72
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,090
e before, we need to save th
changes and go back to the ter

73
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,900
inal and commit that. So we shou
d close P4merge Now back in the

74
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,120
erminal. Let's save the changes
and make a commit. I'm goin

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,260
to accept the default message.
So let's close that we know and

76
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,100
we've successfully mer
ed our branches.
