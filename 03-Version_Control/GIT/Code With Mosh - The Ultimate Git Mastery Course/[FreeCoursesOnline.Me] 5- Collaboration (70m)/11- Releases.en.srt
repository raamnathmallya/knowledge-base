00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,869
One of the GitHub features that
goes hand in hand with tags is

2
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:09,749
release management, we can
create a release to package our

3
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:13,079
software along with source code,
binary files and release notes.

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,409
Let me show you. So here on the
homepage of our repository, we

5
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:20,549
go to tags, and then we go to
the releases tab. Currently, we

6
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:24,899
don't have any releases. So
let's create a new release. Now

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,409
over here, we can find an
existing tag or create a new

8
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:32,459
tag. Currently, we don't have
any tags. So I'm going to type v

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,689
1.0. When I create this release,
GitHub will automatically add

10
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:39,839
this tag to the latest commit.
Next to that, we have our target

11
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:43,709
branch, which is master. Here,
we give our release a title, we

12
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:47,639
can use the same value, version
1.0. Now in this box, we can

13
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:50,819
type our release notes. For
example, we can type a high sign

14
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,529
to add a title and say release
notes. And then using hyphens,

15
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:59,369
we can add bullet points. For
example, we can say, fixed bug

16
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:05,759
one fixed bug to either the form
data. Now we can preview our

17
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:11,069
changes. So here are our release
notes. Beautiful. Now, over

18
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,559
here, we can attach binary
files, so we can include the

19
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:16,469
compiled version of our
application. Now, if this

20
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,739
release is not production ready,
if it's not stable, we can tick

21
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,329
this box. This is a pre release.
And finally, we click on Publish

22
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,349
release. Alright, here's our
first release, we can see our

23
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:31,619
release notes, along with this
assets that GitHub automatically

24
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,609
generated for us included binary
files, like the compiled version

25
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,999
of our application, those binary
files would also be listed here.

26
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:43,049
Okay. Now over here, you can see
this release is based on this

27
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,339
tag, v 1.0, which is added to
the last commit in our

28
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:50,729
repository. Here, we also have a
label saying this is the latest

29
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,909
release of this repository. If
you made a mistake, you can

30
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,789
always delete this release. So
to the right side of this page,

31
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,339
which is not currently in my
recording, we know we have two

32
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:03,269
buttons, edit, release, and
delete. Now, back to the

33
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:07,409
homepage of our repository. Here
on the right side, you can see

34
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,739
all the releases. So this is all
about release management and

35
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,739
GitHub. Just remember, this is
not a good feature. It's a

36
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,069
GitHub feature. It's a high
level feature built on top of

37
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:17,489
tags
