00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,119
In this section, we're going to
use GitHub, which is the most

2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:09,599
popular Git hosting platform. So
it's going to host our central

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,329
repository in the cloud. If you
don't use GitHub in your

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,999
organization, that's perfectly
fine, you should still watch the

5
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:17,759
rest of this section to learn
how to collaborate with others.

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,179
So head over to github.com. If
you don't have an account,

7
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,479
create one, it's free and takes
only a few seconds, just make

8
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:27,899
sure to verify your email before
proceeding. So here, I'm logged

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:35,069
in, let's create a new
repository on the top. Right,

10
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:38,159
first, we give our repository a
theme. I'm going to call this

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,079
Mars, we can optionally give it
a description. Next, we should

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,409
decide if this repository is
going to be public or private.

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,739
If a mark this as public, anyone
on the internet can see this

14
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,789
repository, this is useful for
open source project. If we set

15
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,759
it as private, we choose who can
see and commit to this

16
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,659
repository. But to use a private
repository we have to pay. So

17
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,409
for this demo, I'm going to go
with a public repository. Next,

18
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,839
we can initialize this
repository with a readme file

19
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,409
with a git ignore file and a
license. I'm going to select

20
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,919
this README file over here. So
GitHub is going to add this file

21
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,729
and create the first commit for
us take a look. So create

22
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,769
repository. Here's a repository
and beautiful now look at the

23
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,269
URL github.com, slash your
username, slash your repository.

24
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,079
So anyone on GitHub can have
multiple repositories. Over

25
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,989
here, you can see the current
branch that is Master, we have

26
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,679
only one branch, and zero tags
In this box, we can see th

27
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:40,649
content of our project. S
currently, we have only a singl

28
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:44,369
file, that is a readme file, w
can click on this, to see it

29
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,499
content, pretty basic. Now let'
go back to the top we can se

30
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:52,379
the latest commit, that is th
initial commit that GitHu

31
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,159
created. Here's our commit ID
the date time it was submitted

32
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,849
and here we can see the tota
number of commits. So if w

33
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,709
click here, we can see a log o
all of our recent commits. s

34
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,409
here we can see the commits o
the master branch. If we ha

35
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,109
multiple branches, we coul
select them here to filter th

36
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:13,409
lock. Now to see more detail
about a command, we can click o

37
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:17,939
it. So you can see this commi
was submitted on the maste

38
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,719
branch. It was submitted by m
about five minutes ago. O

39
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,389
course, it actually happened
minute ago, but I had to paus

40
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:27,569
the recording. That is why Her
you can see a summary of th

41
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,469
changes in this commit. So w
have one change file with on

42
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:34,349
addition has zero deletions
That means we have added on

43
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,529
line in this file. Here's th
file we're talking about READ M

44
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:41,699
. And over here you can see a di
f of this file. Alright, now th

45
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:44,099
t we have a repository Next I
m going to show you how to a

46
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,089
