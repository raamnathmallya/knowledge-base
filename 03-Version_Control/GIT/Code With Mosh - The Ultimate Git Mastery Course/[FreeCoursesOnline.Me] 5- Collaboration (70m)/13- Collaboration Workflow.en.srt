1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,749
Let me walk you through a real
collaboration scenario using

2
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:10,169
branches. So let's say Amy and I
are going to work on a feature

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:13,439
together. So one of us should
create a feature branch and push

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,219
it to GitHub. That is one way.
But there is another way, we can

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,969
create a branch directly on
GitHub. So in this drop down

6
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,239
list, we can view all of our
branches. And we can also create

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,389
a new branch. So I'm going to
call this feature slash, change

8
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:33,269
password, enter. Alright, now we
have a new branch. And this

9
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:36,869
branch is currently selected in
this repository. Look over here,

10
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:41,219
this branch is even with Master.
So as we push to this branch, we

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,069
can see how far this branch is
ahead of master. This is very

12
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:47,639
useful. Now back in the
terminal, I'm going to run git

13
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:51,929
fetch to get this new branch. So
we got a new branch called

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,919
feature slash change password,
we also got a new tag, that is

15
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:59,009
the tag that we created earlier
in the section. Now, let me show

16
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,779
you something. If we type git
branch, we only see master what

17
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:07,559
what happened to our new branch.
Well, let's run git branch dash

18
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:12,899
R. Look over here, we have a
remote tracking branch. So when

19
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:16,499
we ran fetch, we only got a
remote tracking branch. Now we

20
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:19,559
should create a private branch
in our local repository that

21
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:24,329
maps to this remote tracking
branch. So we type Git switch, I

22
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:27,689
say, we're going to call this
feature slash Change Password.

23
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:31,259
Now we want this branch or this
pointer to be at the same

24
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,879
location as a remote tracking
branch. So origin, slash feature

25
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,469
slash change, password. All
right, beautiful. Get a saying

26
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,139
that this new branch is set up
to track the remote branch from

27
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,889
origin. Perfect. So here on my
machine, I can add new commits

28
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:53,009
to this branch, and then push
them to origin. Now I'm going to

29
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,829
switch to another terminal
window to simulate Amy's

30
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,149
workspace. So here's Amy's
workspace, Amy is going to start

31
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,709
by cloning this repository. So
we go over here, grab the URL of

32
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:11,129
our repository. Good. Now we
type git clone. Alright, let's

33
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,819
go to this repository. So here
on the Amos workspace, if we

34
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,659
type git branch, once again, we
don't have that feature branch.

35
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,989
So Amish will also create a
private branch that maps to that

36
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,939
remote branch. So Git switch
dicey features slash change

37
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,709
password, this branch should be
based on origin, slash feature,

38
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:37,169
slash Change Password. Great.
Now on behalf of Amy, I'm going

39
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:40,169
to make a commit, and then push
it to GitHub. So something

40
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:45,899
really simple we can Aiko
password, to find one, then make

41
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:50,519
a commit, and say update five
one, then we do a push. So git

42
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,619
push. Beautiful, let's verify
that we have this new commit on

43
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:59,369
GitHub. So here on the homepage
of our repository, we can see

44
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:02,429
this message feature slash
Change Password had recent

45
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:06,119
pushes one minute ago, here, we
have a button for comparing and

46
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,579
creating a pull request. Let's
not worry about it yet. We'll

47
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,729
talk about it soon. Instead,
let's go to the list of our

48
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:14,789
commits. So currently, we have
four commits, these are the

49
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:20,099
commits on master. Let's change
this to our feature branch. So

50
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,519
here's the new commit that I
just pushed beautiful. So Amy

51
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,889
and I are going to keep pushing
to this branch. And in the

52
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,679
meantime, we have to pull each
other's changes. And if there

53
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,839
are conflicts, we have to
resolve them and then do another

54
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:34,259
push. Now at some point, this
feature is going to be complete.

55
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:37,049
Let's say I'm the person
responsible for closing this

56
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,159
branch. So on my machine, first,
I have to bring in Amy's changes

57
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:46,169
set around good, cool. All
right, we have a fast forward

58
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,889
beautiful, let's have a look at
our history. So git log, one

59
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:55,529
line all graph, take a look at
our feature branch is one commit

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,549
ahead of master. So we have to
merge this branch into master.

61
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,499
That is very easy, we switch to
master and then run git merge

62
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,809
feature slash Change Password.
Good. Once again, we have a fast

63
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:12,749
forward merge, because this is a
very simplified example, in a

64
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:16,109
real case scenario, most likely
will have conflicts. But I'm not

65
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,539
gonna repeat that here because
we already talked about

66
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:23,669
resolving conflicts. Now, let's
look at our log again. Look, now

67
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,479
Master, and feature slash Change
Password are pointing to the

68
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,859
same commit. However, origin
slash master is one commit

69
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:35,339
behind master. So here, we have
to do a push to send the final

70
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,479
changes to GitHub. So I'm
currently on Master, I run git

71
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:46,139
push. Alright, our changes are
now in GitHub. Let's look at our

72
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,009
log one more time.

73
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,380
So Master, and origin slash
master are now at the same

74
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,250
location. Beautiful. Now here on
GitHub, we have five commits.

75
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,730
Let's have a quick look here. So
here are the commits on master

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,310
Obviously, we have to commit
that was for implementing the

77
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,370
Change Password feature. So
we're done with this feature,

78
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,930
now should close this branch. So
I'm going to type git push dash

79
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,460
D origin, feature slash change
password, I'm going to remove

80
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,820
this branch from origin, as well
as its remote tracking branch in

81
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,440
my local repository. Good. Now
let's look at our branches. We

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,530
still have this local branch, we
don't need it anymore. So let's

83
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,370
remove it here as well. git
branch dash D, feature slash

84
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,810
Change Password. Beautiful. So
on my machine, I only have the

85
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,720
master branch. Let's look at our
remote tracking branches as

86
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,220
well. git branch dash R. Okay,
we no longer have that remote

87
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,090
tracking branch. Perfect. Now
what about Amy? Well, she is

88
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,420
still on the feature branch. So
on behalf of Amy, first wishes,

89
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,250
switch to master. Now we should
do a pull to bring in the merge

90
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,550
changes that much pushed. So
good pull. Good. So now both Amy

91
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,200
and I have the same history. Now
let's look at our branches. We

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,800
still have the private feature
branch. So let's delete it real

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,320
quick. Good. Now what about our
remote tracking branches? So if

94
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,220
we type git branch, that's our
look, we still have this remote

95
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,590
tracking branch. Even though
this branch is remote from

96
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,710
origin. To remove the tracking
branches that are not under

97
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:29,490
remote, we type Git remote prune
origin. Now look, this remote

98
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,880
tracking branch origin slash
feature slash change password is

99
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,990
pruned. So if you run git branch
dash R, we no longer see that

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,620
remote tracking branch. So this
is how two or more people can

101
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,730
collaborate on a feature
