00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,749
Let's see how we can customize
the list of labels in a GitHub

2
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:12,089
repository. So here on the
issues tab, we go to labels. On

3
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:15,029
this page, we can see all the
default labels that exist in

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,559
every GitHub repository. We can
create a new label, let's say

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,489
refactoring. We can optionally
give it a description and a

6
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:26,519
color. If you don't like this
color, you can click here,

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,909
GitHub automatically generates a
new color that is reflected over

8
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:35,129
here. Now let's create the
label. Good. Now look over here.

9
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,939
For the enhancement label. We
have one open issue or pull

10
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,509
request. So this is also another
useful report. We can see all

11
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,269
the labels and the number of
open issues assigned to them in

12
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:45,959
one place.
