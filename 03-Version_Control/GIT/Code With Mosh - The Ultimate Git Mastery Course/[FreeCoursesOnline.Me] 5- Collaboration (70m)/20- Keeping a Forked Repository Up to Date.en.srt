1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,290
So here's the repository for an
open source project, we fork

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,800
this repository to contribute to
it. Now there is a problem. This

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,860
forked repository is not
connected to the original or the

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,370
base repository. So from time to
time, it can get out of sync

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,490
with the base repository. If
other people contribute to the

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,970
base repository and add new
commits to the master branch, we

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,460
are not going to be aware of
those new commits. In this

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,680
lesson, I'm going to show you
how to keep this forked

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,280
repository up to date. So in
this local repository on our

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,220
machine, we have a reference to
our forked repository called

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,670
origin. Right, we can add
another reference to the base

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,910
repository, and then use the
pull command to bring in the new

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,970
commits. And then we can push
them to our forked repository.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,630
As simple as that. Let's see
this in action. Earlier, we

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,570
briefly talked about the remote
command. With this command, we

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,630
can manage the remote
repositories. So currently, we

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,440
have a single remote that is
origin, we can run git remote

18
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,430
dash V, that is short for
variables to see more details

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,610
about these remote repositories.
So here, we have two channels,

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,180
fetch for getting the objects
and push for pushing objects,

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,370
both these channels are mapped
to this URL. Now to add a new

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,290
remote, we type Git remote add,
we give it a name, like base, or

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,020
a lot of people like to call it
upstream, you can call it

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,630
whatever you want, it doesn't
really matter. Now wanted to

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,610
grab the URL of the base or the
original repository. So here on

26
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,880
my personal GitHub account,
here's our Villa repository, I'm

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,850
going to grab the URL, and then
paste it over here. Good. Now,

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,150
let's look at our remote
repositories. So we have origin

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,320
and upstream. Once again, we can
run remote dash v. So you can

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,610
see origin is pointing to Bitly
in my Code with Mosh account,

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,200
hereas upstream is pointing to
it name, in my personal

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,500
ccount, okay. Now, let's say we
ade a mistake, and we want to

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,130
ename this remote repository.
e simply type Git remote

34
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,440
ename, and we want to rename
pstream to base that's better.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,950
f you're done with a remote, we
an simply remove it, we type

36
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,360
it remote, RM, and then we type
he name. Alright, so we're done

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,660
ere. Now I'm going to go to my
riginal or the base repository,

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,250
nd make a new commit. So here
n my personal account, I'm

39
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,820
oing to edit this README file.
o let's add a new line of code

40
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:38,340
nd then make a commit. Good. So
e added a new commit to the

41
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,430
aster branch of the base
epository. Now I'm going to

42
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,230
witch to my forked repository.
ow on my code with my account,

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,250
ook over here, GitHub is saying
hat this branch, our master

44
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,270
ranch, is one commit behind the
aster of the base repository.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,960
o back in the terminal, we need
o use the fetch or the pull

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,260
ommand to bring in the new
ommits. So I'm going to use

47
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,500
etch for now, the earlier the
ection, we use the fetch

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,830
ommand, without specifying the
ame of the remote, I told you

49
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,800
hat if we don't supply the name
f the remote, by default,

50
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,500
rigin will be assume. Now in
his case, we don't want to

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,140
etch the commits from origin,
ecause that is a forked

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,990
epository, we want to get the
ew commits from the base

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,110
epository. So here we type
ase. Good. So we got a new

54
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,520
ranch called base slash master.
ow let's look at our history.

55
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,610
o here's our local master
ranch. And here's the master

56
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,960
ranch of the base repository.
o our local master is behind

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,780
he master of the base
epository. So we should merge

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,700
ase slash master into our local
aster. So first, we switch to

59
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,980
aster and then run git merge
ase slash master. Now, in this

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,280
ase, because the local master
s not diverged from the remote

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,430
aster, we're going to have a
ast forward merge, take a look.

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,000
here you go. Fast forward. Now,
et's look at the history one

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,640
ore time. Okay, so now our
ocal master and base slash

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,300
aster are pointing to the same
ommit beautiful. So our local

65
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,240
epository is in sync with the
ase repository. Now I'm going

66
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,310
o push the changes into our
orked repository. So git push.

67
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,710
ow, back on my Code with Mosh a
count on GitHub, when I r

68
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,920
fresh the page, this notice is g
ing to go away. Take a look. N

69
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,200
w, GitHub is saying that this b
anch is even with the master o

70
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,530
the base repository, b
autiful. So this is how we can k

71
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,640
ep a fork repository up to d
te. Now back to the terminal, i

72
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,790
's always a good practice to m
rge the master branch into y

73
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,220
ur local feature branch, b
cause this will reduce the c

74
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,950
ance for conflicts in the f
ture. If there are changes in t

75
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,950
e master that will affect your w
rk. You want to make sure that y

76
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,400
ur work is on top of those c
anges. So we're going to s

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,170
itch to our bug fix branch.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,180
And then run git merge Master,
we're going to bring in the

79
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,110
changes in master into the
current branch. That look, we

80
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,560
have a conflict. So by resolving
the conflicts locally at this

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,920
point in time, we'll reduce the
chance for future conflicts when

82
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,740
the maintainer of the project
wants to merge and close our

83
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,490
pull requests.
