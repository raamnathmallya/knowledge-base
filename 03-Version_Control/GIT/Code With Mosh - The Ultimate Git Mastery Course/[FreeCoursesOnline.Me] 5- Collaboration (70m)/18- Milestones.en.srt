1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,199
Now let's talk about milestones.
We use milestones to track the

2
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:10,349
progress of various issues. So
we can add a bunch of issues to

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,079
a milestone, and then see how
much we have progress in that

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:17,909
milestone. So here on the issues
tab, we go to milestones and

5
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:21,989
create a new milestone, we give
it a title. This can be anything

6
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,719
that is meaningful to the team.
For example, if you're working

7
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,229
on version two of our software,
the title can be 2.0 point oh,

8
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:32,189
now optionally, we can give it a
due date. So I'm going to set

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,469
this to, let's say, 30th of
September 2020. We can also give

10
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,849
it a description, and then
create the milestone. So here we

11
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:45,989
have one open milestone that is
due by September 30. Now over

12
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,779
here, you can see the progress
of this milestone. Currently, we

13
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:52,199
don't have any issues or
scientist milestone. So let's go

14
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,549
to the issues page and select
this issue. And of course, we

15
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,169
could select multiple issues,
and then put them in a

16
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:07,319
particular milestone. Good. Now,
look over here. This issue is

17
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,499
assigned to our version two
milestone. Now let's go to the

18
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:15,569
milestones tab. Now look over
here, we have one open issue

19
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,229
zero closed, and we're at zero
percent complete. If I close

20
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,779
this issue, our milestone will
be complete. Let me show you

21
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:26,639
real quick. So we go to the
issues. I'm going to select this

22
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:34,199
issue and then mark it as
closed. Okay, good. Now back to

23
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:38,639
the milestones page. Look at our
milestone is complete. This is a

24
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:39,779
very useful report.
