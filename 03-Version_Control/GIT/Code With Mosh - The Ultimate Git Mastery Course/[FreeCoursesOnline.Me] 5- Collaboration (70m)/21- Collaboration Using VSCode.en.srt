00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,630
Let's see how we can work with
remote repositories here in VS

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,840
code. Unfortunately, we have
limited collaboration tools here

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,540
compared to GitKraken. But let
me walk you through the tools we

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,530
have here real quick. So we go
to GitLens. We talked about this

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,530
earlier in the course, we can
right click on our repository.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,060
Here, we have fetch, pull, push,
and push for us. Now one thing

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,060
that I like about get Labs is
that it tells us how far we are

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,930
behind or ahead of a branch in
origin. So we're currently on

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,900
the bug fix branch, I'm going to
create a new commit, and then

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,990
GitLens. will tell us that we
are one commit ahead of origin

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,120
slash bug fix, take a look. So
I'm going to change our README

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,490
file and add a new line. Save.
Now, let's come in and say

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,840
update README. Good. Now, back
in GitLens. Take a look.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,890
GitLens's saying, we have one
coming ahead, we can expand this

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,970
folder and see the commit that
we have to push to origin. So we

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,330
can click on this icon and push
this and here we have three

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,510
options. We can do a regular
push, we can do a force push or

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,270
cancel. And as I told you
before, you should not really

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,580
use a force push that often
unless you have screwed

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,260
something up. So let's go with a
regular push. Good. Now the

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,110
first time you're going to see
this pop up saying extension

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,630
GitHub wants to sign in using
GitHub. So let's allow that. Now

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,080
we have authorized visual city
code to access GitHub. Let's go

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,630
with that. And then confirm.
Here we have to enter our

25
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,110
password. Okay, perfect. Now,
back to VS code. It's saying

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,770
that GitHub authentication wants
to open a UI. That's totally

27
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,440
fine. Let's open it. Good. Now
we have this prompt here saying,

28
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,710
Would you like code to
periodically run git fetch, I

29
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,440
find this pretty useful because
it tells us how far we are

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,390
behind origin. So let's allow
that. Good. So we're done with

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,320
pushing. Now unfortunately, here
we cannot push tags or branches

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,560
at this not at the time of
recording this video. So to push

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,860
a branch or a tag, we have to go
back to the terminal. Another

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,760
tool we have here is remote. so
here we can see we have two

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,070
remote, base and origin. We can
add a new remote or rename or

36
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,220
remove an existing one. So these
are pretty much all the

37
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,160
collaboration tools we have in
GitLens, GitKraken is a lot

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,720
better. We'll look at that.
Next.
