1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,660
Quite often as part of
implementing a feature or fixing

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,570
a bug, we would like other team
members feedback about our code.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,870
This is where we use pull
requests. With a pull request,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,900
we essentially open a discussion
the team before merging and

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,570
branch into Master, let me walk
you through a real scenario.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,930
Let's say Amy is going to
implement a new feature. So here

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,110
on Amy's machine, I'm going to
start a new branch, add a commit

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,070
to it, and then push it to
GitHub. So Git switch,dash C

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,110
feature slash login, Dallas,
Echo Hello, two, file three dot

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,530
txt stays the file, make a
comment and say, write hello to

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,510
file three. Now let's push this
branch. So git push the first

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,930
time we should use doshu. To set
the upstream branch. We're going

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,070
to push this to origin and call
it feature slash login. Now I

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,560
need to enter my credentials
because the cache has expired.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,870
All right, beautiful. Now here
on GitHub, we see this message

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,410
feature slash login had recent
pushes one minute ago, we can

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,740
compare and create a pull
request. Alternatively, we can

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,490
go to the pull request tab and
create a new pull request from

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,110
here. On this page, we have to
select two branches, the base

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,830
branch, which is often Master,
and the target branch, which is

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,970
our feature branch. So before
merging this branch into Master,

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,850
we want to start a pull request
or a discussion of the team.

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,970
Now, because we're dealing with
a simple change, only a single

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,540
commit and no conflicts, we can
see that we can automatically

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,900
merge the changes. Quite often
that's not the case, we often

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,330
have conflicts that we have to
resolve. We'll talk about that

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,260
later. Now over here, we can see
the summary of changes. So we

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,980
have one commit, one file
change, zero comments and one

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,340
contributor. Here's the command
that we just pushed, right hello

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,910
to five three. Over here, we can
see the summary of changes. So

31
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,500
we are this line in five, three
dot txt. Beautiful. Now, let's

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,680
go ahead and create the pull
request. In this case, because

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,800
we have a single commit, GitHub
used our commit message as the

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,500
title for this pull request, I'm
going to change this to

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,710
something more descriptive. So
we're implementing a new

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,240
feature. for social login, we
want to allow the user to login

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,420
via Facebook. So social login,
that's better. Here, we can

38
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,330
write some details about this
pull request, and see if there

39
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,270
are things that we want other
people to review. Specifically,

40
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,080
we can list them here. Now let's
go ahead and create this pull

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,430
request. All right, here's our
pull request. Beautiful. It's

42
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,700
saying Code with Mosh wants to
erge one commit into master

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,780
rom feature slash login. Now,
et's say I'm Amy, so I'm going

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,030
o add mosh as a reviewer. So
ver here, here, we can see all

45
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,220
he collaborators in this
roject. Earlier in this

46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,060
ection, I told you how to add
ollaborators. So I'm going to

47
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,000
dd mosh yet. Now we have a
ellow icon here saying we are

48
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,360
waiting request a review from
osh hamadani. So Mosh is goi

49
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,600
g to get an email saying ame
is your review. Now I'm goi

50
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,300
g to open another browser win
ow on behalf of Mosh. Alri

51
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,030
ht, here's Mosh's screen. On thi
page, we're going to go to pul

52
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,040
requests. We have one open p
ll requests. So let's take a

53
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,270
look. Look at this messag
. Code with Mosh request

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,020
d your review on this pull re
uest. So I can go ahead and add

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,750
my review. Now this box pops un
er this button review changes

56
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,710
I find this confusing, so I al
ays like to click away to clos

57
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,530
it and get back to it later.
ere we can see the summary

58
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,410
of all the changes. So in this
case, we have a single file fi

59
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,160
e, three, and we have this ne
line in this file, we can add

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,130
comments to individual lines b
clicking on this icon. I can s

61
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,830
y this line is good, but it's be
ter. If you capitalize, ah, of

62
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,120
ourse, I can write a rich re
iew using bold and italic

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,810
tuff. But let's not worry a
out it. So let's start our rev

64
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,530
ew. So I added one comment
to this line of code. And of

65
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,040
ourse I could add many more co
ments. Now I'm going to finish

66
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,970
y review and write a general
description saying please

67
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,630
ake these changes and do another
push. I can mark this as comment

68
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,140
I can approve this pull request
or I can request more changes

69
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,260
I'm going to request more ch
nges and submit my review.

70
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,930
Good. Now we are on the convers
tion tab, we can see the timelin

71
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,200
of things that have happene
. So initially, Amy started

72
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,070
this pull request with his det
ils. Here's the initial commit,

73
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,670
right hello to five three,
hen Amy or this gets called

74
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,030
ith multiple requests that a
eview and then Mosh Hamedani

75
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,480
requested changes. And here are
the details about this changes.

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,140
So the general comment, as well
s comments the individu

77
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,900
l lines of code. Also over her

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,640
we see this red icon can't sing
much hamadani requested changes.

79
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,510
Now back on Amy's machine, let's
make a change and do another

80
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,790
push. So I'm going to echo Hello
with a capital H 253 dot txt,

81
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,050
then I'm going to stage and
commit all the changes, say

82
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,580
capitalize, hello, then let's do
a push. So Amy did a push. Now

83
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,140
back on GitHub, she can come
over here and request Mosh to

84
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,020
eview the code again. So this
ill send Mosh a new n

85
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,920
tification and you email, B
lla, come back here and see t

86
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,500
is message one more time code w
th Mosh request said your re

87
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,700
iew on this pull request. So I
an add my second review. Once ag

88
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,960
in, I like to click away and se
the updated code. So I think th

89
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,710
s is great. I'm going to take th
s file as reviewed. And then su

90
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,850
mit my final review. So I'm go
ng to say everything looks pe

91
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,240
fect. Let's go ahead with me
ging. And then I can select ap

92
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,590
rove and submit the review. Al
ight, the changes are ap

93
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,780
roved beautiful. Now up here on
the conversation tab. Next to th

94
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,810
s reviewer. Now we have a ti
k so we can go ahead with me

95
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,270
ging. To do that. Go down be
ow, and we have this button me

96
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,960
ge pull request. Here's a qu
stion who should merge this pu

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,260
l request? Well, there are tw
opinions. Some teams believe th

98
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,110
t the person who started a pu
l request should not be able to

99
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,140
close it, the pull request wi
l always be close by someone el

100
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,680
e. Otherwise, these pull re
uests are meaningless. Anyone ca

101
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,290
start and close them. But th
re's also a different opinion ou

102
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,230
there. Some people argue th
t the person who started a pu

103
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,620
l request knows about that is
ue the most. So when it comes to

104
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,530
merging, most likely we're go
ng to have conflict, it's re

105
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,860
lly helpful to have that pe
son on board. So they argue th

106
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,590
t the person who opens a pull re
uest should be the one cl

107
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,070
sing it as well. So there's re
lly no right or wrong, it re

108
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,220
lly depends on your team's cu
ture. Now, here we have a few op

109
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,110
ions. We can create a merge co
mit, we can squash on merge, or

110
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,650
we can rebase and merge. We co
ered all these options be

111
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:14,820
ore. So I'm going to go with a
imple merge commit. All ri

112
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,580
ht, our pull requests su
cessfully merged and closed. No

113
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,690
we can delete this branch. Go
d. If you made a mistake, we ca

114
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,860
always come back here and re
tore the branch back on his ma

115
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,550
hine, let's switch to master an
then do a pool.

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,300
Beautiful. Now let's look at the
history.

117
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,680
Alright, so this last commit
over here is our merge commit

118
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,250
merge pull request number one
from Code with Mosh slash

119
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,240
feature slash login. Both my
master and origin slash master

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,930
are pointing to the same commit,
we no longer need this feature

121
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,110
branch. So we should delete this
local branch as well as the

122
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,780
remote tracking branch. We
already removed this branch from

123
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,930
GitHub. So now we need to remove
it from this repository. To do

124
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,910
that we type Git remote prune
origin. As I told you before,

125
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,120
this removes the branches that
don't exist on the remote in

126
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,680
this case origin. So now if we
type git branch dash R, we don't

127
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,470
have that remote tracking branch
beautiful. Finally, we need to

128
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,790
remove our local branch so git
branch dash D feature slash log
