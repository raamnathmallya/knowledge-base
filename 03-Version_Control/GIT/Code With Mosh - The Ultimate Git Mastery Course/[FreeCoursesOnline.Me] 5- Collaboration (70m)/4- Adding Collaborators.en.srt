1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,930
So even though this repository
is public, no one but me can

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,200
push array to it. Other people
can see my code and commit

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,230
history, but they cannot push
new commits. So if you work in a

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,630
team, you should add your team
members here and give them push

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,290
access. Let me show you how to
do this. So over here, we have a

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,930
tab on the right side, called
settings.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,230
Here we go to manage access.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,750
Now, look, currently, we don't
have any collaborators, we can

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,080
invite our team members by their
GitHub username, full name or

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,790
email. So I'm going to look
myself up. Here's my other

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,150
GitHub account. But please,
please, please don't invite me I

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,640
don't want to get 1000
notifications. Every time

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,060
someone watches this course I'm
just following along. So I'm

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,500
going to add myself. Now I have
an invitation that is pending.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,290
So I'm going to get an email and
in that email, there is a link

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,680
for me to accept or decline the
invitation and once I accept the

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,740
invitation, then I'll have push
access to this repository.
