1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,259
Let's look at the collaboration
tools and GitKraken. So cu

2
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:10,199
rently we are on the bug fix br
nch, we can right click this br

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,489
nch or any of the branches. He
e we have pull, push, instead up

4
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:18,239
tream. With sin upstream, we ca
map a local branch to a br

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,169
nch in a remote repository. He
e, unlike VS code, we can pu

6
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:25,169
h our branches and tags. So I'
going to create a new branch of

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,899
of master. So I'm going to ri
ht click this commit, which is

8
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,849
the last commit on master and th
n create a new branch called

9
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:33,539
feature.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,270
Alright, now let's make a small
change and add a new commit to

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,600
this branch. So I'm going to go
to README file and write

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,210
something here. Save Now, let's
make a comment and say update

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,450
README. Good. So our feature
branch has moved forward. Now we

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,320
can push this branch

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,290
directly to our GitHub
repository. So right click and

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,430
push,

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,970
GitKraken is asking the name o
the remote branch. So I want t

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,150
accept the default value h
re. That is feature Submit. N

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,910
w the first time we want to p
sh, we have to get an a

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,000
thorization token. Here we h
ve three options, refresh t

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,230
ken, retry without auth. And c
ncel, I'm going to refresh my t

22
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,790
ken. Just like before, we have t
authorize GitKraken to acce

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,400
s GitHub. So let's continue

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,680
and confirm.

25
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,680
Good. Now back to GitKraken, we
push successfully beautiful, pu

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,210
hing tax is exactly the same. So
here on Master, I can right cl

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,520
ck and create a new tag. Le
's call that version 1.0.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
Now, we can

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,570
right click this tag and push it
to a remote repository. Here we

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,810
have two remotes, base and
origin, we can push to one of

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,380
these repositories or to all of
them. So GitKrakenhas a lot mor

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,500
features than GitLens. Here,
we can also manage our remot

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,630
s. So on the left side, we curre
tly have two remotes, base and o

34
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,840
igin, we can add a new remot
, pretty straightforward. One m

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,140
re thing I love about GitKraken
is managing pull requests

36
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,340
So here we have another
anel for our pull requests

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,430
So here are all the pull req
ests we have in our base rep

38
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,330
sitory, we can easily create a
new pull request. So let's sa

39
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,540
we're done with this feature
ranch. Now we're going to start

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,750
a pull request, until the main
ainer of this project, bring ou

41
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,260
changes into the original
repository. So we right click th

42
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,000
s branch and then start a pull r
quest to base from origin s

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,740
ash feature. Take a look. So
we were starting a pull request

44
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,670
o merge the feature branch o
our forked repository into the

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,680
master of this base reposito
y. Just like before, we can give

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,110
this Pull Request a title, a
description,

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,990
and then create the pull
request.

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,840
Perfect, we're done.

49
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,009
Now here in the original or the
base repository, we can see our

50
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,139
new pull request. It's right
here.
