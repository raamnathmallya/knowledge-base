1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,450
So at the beginning of the
course, I told you that version

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,960
control systems fall into two
groups, centralized and

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,470
distributed. In centralized
systems like subversion, you

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,280
have a single repository that is
shared by all team members. The

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,400
problem with this system is that
everyone is dependent on this

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,280
central repository. If the
server that is hosting this

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,820
repository goes offline, no one
can commit or view the project

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,810
history. In distributed systems
like git, every developer has a

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,690
repository on their machine. So
they're not dependent on a

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,480
central server, they can work
offline with their local

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,660
repository. But how can we
collaborate with this model?

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,720
Well, we can synchronize our
work directly with each other.

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,710
But this is often too complex
and error prone. Instead, we can

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,160
use what we call the centralized
workflow. So everyone has their

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,490
local repository, but there's
also a central repository they

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,700
used to synchronize their work.
This is the workflow used in

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,030
most private teams and closed
source projects. But you might

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,300
be asking, Hey, Mosh, what is
the point of this workflow? How

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,090
is it better than a centralized
version control system like

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,330
subversion? Well, with this
model, we don't have a single

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,450
point of failure, we can work
with our local repository. And

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,940
if a central repository is
unavailable for a period of

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,780
time, we can synchronize our
work directly. Now, where should

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,930
we put the central repository,
so it's accessible to all team

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,510
members? Well, some
organizations put this

26
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,110
repository on a server in their
private network. Others prefer

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,920
to use Git hosting services like
GitHub, git lab, Gitbucket, and

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,880
so on. With all these services,
we can set up a repository as a

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,390
private repository. So it's only
accessible to our team and no

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,530
one else. So let's walk through
a real scenario. John and Amy

31
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,230
want to collaborate on a
project. They start off by

32
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,400
cloning or taking a copy of this
central repository. And now they

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,640
both have a local repository on
their machine. So John starts

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,270
working and makes a few commits,
me could be making other commits

35
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,390
In the meantime, but let's not
worry about that yet. Now, at

36
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,110
some point, john needs to share
his work with Amy. To do that,

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,200
he uses the push command to send
his commits to the central

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,500
repository. The central
repository is now in sync with

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,790
John's work. Now, Amy can use
the pull command to bring in

40
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,390
John's work into her local
repository. If John's work

41
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,960
conflicts with Amy's work, she
has to resolve the conflicts and

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,170
then push our changes to the
central repository. So this is

43
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,170
the centralized workflow, which
is used in most private teams,

44
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,380
everyone in the team has pushed
access to right to the central

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,650
repository, we have another
workflow for open source

46
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,250
projects called integration
manager workflow. In an open

47
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,220
source project, we have one or
more maintainers, and many

48
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,830
contributors. The problem is
that we don't know this

49
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,040
contributors. So we cannot trust
them enough to give them push a

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,160
write access to our repository,
only the maintainers of the

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,640
project have pushed access to
the project repository. So if

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,580
you want to contribute, first,
we should fork the project

53
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,540
repository to get a copy of this
repository in the cloud. Next,

54
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,410
we clone this repository to get
a local copy on our machine, we

55
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,170
make a few commits, and when
we're ready to share our work,

56
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,490
we do a push to send our commits
to our forked repository. Next,

57
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,490
we send a pull request to the
maintainer of the project. This

58
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,130
is a feature built into
platforms like GitHub, I'll show

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,340
you how to do that later in this
section. So the maintainer of

60
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,340
the project gets notified, then
they can pull in our changes,

61
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,790
review them. And if they're
happy, they can merge our work

62
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,910
into their local repository, and
then push the merge changes to

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,270
the official repository. This is
called the integration manager

64
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,480
workflow. Because someone is in
charge of integrating changes,

65
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,230
we cannot push directly to this
official repository. That's why

66
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,590
we have to fork it to get a copy
in the cloud. Because this

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,950
repository is in the cloud. It's
also visible to the maintainer

68
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,680
of the project, and that's how
they can pull in our changes.

69
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,530
Alright, that's it for
workflows. Next, we're going to

70
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,620
create a GitHub repository to
see this workflows in action.
