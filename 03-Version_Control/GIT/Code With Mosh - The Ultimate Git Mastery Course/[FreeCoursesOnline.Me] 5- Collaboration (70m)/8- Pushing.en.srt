1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,099
So in our local repository, our
master branch is of origin slash

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,519
master by one commit. So we can
use the push command to send

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,669
this new commit to origin. When
we run this command, git will

4
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,549
send our new commit to the
remote repository, then it will

5
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:21,659
move the master pointer forward
2.2 C. And finally it would move

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:27,479
origin slash Master 2.2 C as
well. So we type git push. Next,

7
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,389
we specified the remote
repository in this case, origin.

8
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:34,409
And finally, we specified the
branch we want to push master.

9
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,619
There, currently, we are on the
master branch so we can drop

10
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,879
master. Also, if a drop origin
is good, we'll assume origin by

11
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,019
default. So we just type git
push. Here, we have to enter our

12
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:49,679
GitHub credentials. So I'm going
to add my email

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,750
and password.

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,990
Good. So get sent our new coming
to origin. Let's verified real

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,950
quick. So here on GitHub, look,
we have four commands. And

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,090
here's the last commit that we
just pushed at file one. Now,

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,930
sometimes your push may get
rejected. Let's see why. So once

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,380
again, our local repository is
ahead of origin by one commit.

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,980
Now let's say before we do a
push, someone else does a push

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,640
an add a new commit to origin.
Now, if we do a push, our push

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,190
will get rejected, because our
histories have evolved

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,520
differently. So good prevents us
from overwriting someone else's

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,700
work, that I've seen some people
using the force option here,

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,850
this is a terrible thing you can
do with this, you're telling it

25
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,570
to drop other people's work, and
replace it with your work. This

26
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,660
is not what we want. So unless
you have a very strong reason

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,720
for using the force option, you
should never ever, ever, ever

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,540
use this option. Basically, you
should use this only if you have

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,010
screwed things up. So what can
we do here? Well, we have to do

30
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,460
a poll to bring other people's
work into our local repository.

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,910
And then we have to do a merge
or a rebase. If there are any

32
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,120
conflicts, we have to resolve
them, and then we can do a push.

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,180
Here's a question for you look
at the history of these two

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,420
repositories. What comments do
we have in our local repository

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,950
that don't exist in origin, C
and M, right? Because in both

36
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,960
these repositories, we have a, b
and d. So when we do a push, git

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,170
will send these two commits to
the origin. Now we have the same

38
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,440
state in both these
repositories. The final code and

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,090
the history of changes are
identical.
