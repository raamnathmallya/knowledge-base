00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,329
In the previous lesson, you saw
that when I tried to push my

2
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:09,749
commits, I had to enter my
GitHub credentials, my GitHub

3
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:12,689
username and password. Now we
don't enter our credentials

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,539
every time you want to do a push
that is too tedious and time

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,689
consuming. The good news is that
we can store our credentials in

6
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:22,139
memory or on disk, and tell Git
where to find it, all we have to

7
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:26,399
do is to set a configuration
value. So we type Git config,

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,189
dash dash global, we said
credential, that helper to it,

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,669
we set it to cash, it will store
our credentials for 15 minutes

10
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,729
in memory. If that's not
sufficient for you, and you want

11
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:42,059
to store your credentials per
Mac on disk. On Mac, you have to

12
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,489
use key chain. And on Windows,
you have to use Windows

13
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,029
credential store. These are both
storages for storing sensitive

14
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:51,569
data. So our credentials will
get stored in an encrypted way.

15
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,169
So if you're on Mac, first, you
have to find out if key chain

16
00:00:55,169 --> 00:01:00,599
helper is installed or not. So
we type Git credential, dash OS

17
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:05,399
X key chain. As you can see,
kitchen helper is installed on

18
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,129
my machine. If it's not
installed on your machine, you

19
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,069
will see the instructions to
install it, it's very easy. Once

20
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,299
you install kitchen helper, then
you said Git config, dash dash

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,419
global credential, that helper
to OS X key chain, that's all

22
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:24,509
you have to do. If you're a
Windows user, you have to

23
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,809
install get credential manager
for Windows. So head over to

24
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:32,069
github.com slash Microsoft slash
get credential manager for

25
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,699
Windows. On this page, you can
find that installer is right

26
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:38,519
here. So download this and
follow the instructions.

27
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,919
Unfortunately, I don't have a
Windows machine to show the

28
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,259
process, but it should be very
easy. You shouldn't have any

29
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:43,919
problems.
