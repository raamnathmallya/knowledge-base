1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,779
Now what if you have conflicts
when merging and closing a pull

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,289
request? Well, once again on his
machine, I'm going to start a

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,189
new branch, add a commit, push
it, create a pull request. And

4
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,799
in the meantime, I'm going to
create a conflict and change on

5
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,619
master. So when we merge this
branch into Master, we get a

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,509
conflict. So let's create a new
branch called feature slash, log

7
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:28,529
out. Now on this branch, I'm
going to write hello to file one

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,749
dot txt. Let's commit the
changes and say write hello to

9
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:39,089
file one. Now let's push this
branch. So push that shoe origin

10
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:44,759
feature slash logout. Now on
GitHub, we have this new branch

11
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:48,089
feature slash logout, we can
start a pull request. But before

12
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:52,079
doing so let's add a conflict
and change in master. So back to

13
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,249
Amy's machine. Let's switch to
master and write something

14
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:59,909
different to find one. So I'm
going to write world two file

15
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:05,099
one dot txt. Now let's commit
the changes, right world to find

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,729
one, and then do a push. Of
course, this doesn't have to

17
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,699
happen on a machine, someone
else might have a pull request

18
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:15,269
that is open, that pull request
might get merged into master. So

19
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,839
master can move forward without
me being aware of that. Okay,

20
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:22,679
either way, we have a conflict
and change. So let's go ahead.

21
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,719
Now let's say Amy has finished
her work. So she wants to start

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,139
a pull request. So over here, we
click on compare and pull

23
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:35,579
request. Now look, GitHub is
saying that it cannot

24
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,519
automatically merge the changes
because we have conflicts. But

25
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,909
don't worry, we can still create
the pull request. So let's give

26
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,109
it the title, feature logout and
I'm going to leave out the

27
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:49,499
description doesn't really
matter. All right, now we have a

28
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:52,889
pull request. At some point in
the future, we want to merge and

29
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:56,759
close this pull request. Now
look over here. GitHub is saying

30
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:00,089
this branch has conflicts that
must be resolved. So here we

31
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:03,299
have two options, we can use the
command line or use the GitHub

32
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,969
user interface. If you want to
use the command line, the

33
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,479
process is exactly like before.
So someone who is in charge of

34
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,689
merging, it could be Amy or
someone else. And that person

35
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,569
first has to pull in the latest
code, then they have to start

36
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,179
the merge process, they're gonna
get conflicts and they'll

37
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,969
resolve the conflicts, add a new
commit, and then push it to

38
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:24,239
GitHub. Exactly like before,
nothing different. So in this

39
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,759
lesson, I'm going to show you
how to resolve conflicts on

40
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,719
GitHub. That is very simple. So
we click on resolve conflicts.

41
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:35,369
Now on this page, we can see all
the conflict in files on the

42
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:38,819
left and this case, we have a
single file and on the right we

43
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,119
can see our conflict markers.
You have seen these before. So

44
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,349
in this branch feature slash
logout, we have added Hello, on

45
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,049
this branch on Master, we have
added world, so we need to

46
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,019
decide what changes we need. In
this case, I'm going to bring

47
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,309
the changes in both these
branches. So let's delete the

48
00:02:56,309 --> 00:03:00,929
markers. You're left with hello
world. If you have multiple

49
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:05,549
conflicts, we can browse through
them using these buttons. Now,

50
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,629
let's mark this as resolved.
Good. So now we need to commit

51
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:16,139
the changes onto feature slash
logout. So commit. Good. Now

52
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,709
back to our pull request. Down
below, we no longer have that

53
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,669
message sent or conflict. So we
can go ahead and merge the pull

54
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,579
request. Done
