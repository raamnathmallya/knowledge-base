00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,540
One of the features of GitHub
that goes hand in hand with pull

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,890
requests is issue tracking. So
here on the issues tab, we can

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,070
track all kinds of issues like
bug fixes, new features,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,980
enhancements, or any kind of
ideas we want to discuss in the

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,310
team.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,770
So let me walk you through a
real example. I'm going to

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,610
create a new issue.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,620
We give it a descriptive title,
like, send email on someone

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,610
signs up. Here, we can write
more details about this issue,

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,330
we can also attach files, this
is very useful, it's much easier

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,660
than tossing emails around. So
all the details we're working on

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,290
an issue are encapsulated in a
single place. Here, we can

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,260
optionally assign this issue to
one or more people, if we know

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,860
ahead of time. If not, people
can come in and assign issues to

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,770
themselves. In this case, I'm
going to assign this issue to

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,960
myself. Okay. And we can also
add labels to this issue. So

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,490
every Git repository has these
labels by default. We have bug

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,240
documentation, duplicate
enhancement, and so on. We can

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,760
also customize these labels.
I'll show you how to do that in

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,370
the next lesson. So let's add
enhancement. Now, let's go ahead

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,800
and submit a new issue. All
right, here's our issue. On this

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,770
page, we can have a conversation
about this issue. So anyone in

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,800
the team can come in and leave
comments. This is very useful.

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,100
Now one thing that I love here
is that we can link this issue

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,640
with a pull request. With this,
when we merge and close a pull

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,880
request, this issue will be
automatically closed, we can

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
also assign this issue to a
milestone, I'm going to talk

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,030
about that later in the section.
If this issue is not linked to a

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,210
pull request, we can always come
in here and close this issue

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,820
manually. Now, let's go back to
the list of issues. So we have a

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,630
single issue here. That is an
enhancement, you can immediately

32
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,720
see that I am working on this
issue. This is very useful in

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,600
teams. So anyone can come in
here and see who is working on

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,210
what. And if someone doesn't
have any work to do, they can

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,560
always come in here and pick an
issue. So I can come in here and

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,010
assign this issue to myself if
it's not assigned to someone

37
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,170
else. Now let's go back. Here we
can filter the list by author,

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,490
label project milestones
assignees. And we can also sort

39
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,040
the result in different ways.
I'm not going to go through

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,470
these they're really simple, you
can figure them out on your own.

41
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,680
Next I'm going to show you how
to customize the list of labels.
