1
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,869
By default, the push command
doesn't transfer our tags to a

2
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:10,379
remote repository, we have to
explicitly push them. So let's

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:14,789
create a new tag called version
1.0. This tag is added to the

4
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:20,039
last commit. Let's verify it
real quick. Okay, so here's our

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,429
tag. Now this tag is only
available in this repository on

6
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,399
my machine. If I want to send
this to GitHub and share it with

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,679
other team members, I have to
type git push origin, v 1.0.

8
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:37,439
Alright, beautiful. Our tag is
now on GitHub. Let's verified

9
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,699
real quick. So I refresh the
page. Here we have one tag.

10
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,329
Let's click here. On this page,
we can see the list of all the

11
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,839
tags in this repository, we can
click a tag to see more details.

12
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,539
So we can see who has created
this tag when and over here, you

13
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,629
can see these assets that GitHub
automatically generated for us.

14
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,809
So we can download our entire
source code at this point in

15
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,159
time. This is very useful. If we
push this type by accident, we

16
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,549
can remove it using the push
command. So we type git push

17
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,659
origin, exactly like before, but
before the tag name, we type

18
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:16,559
dash dash, delete. This is going
to delete this tag from origin.

19
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:22,679
Take a look. All right, our tag
is gone. So back on GitHub, we

20
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:26,309
no longer have a tag. But this
tag is still in my repository.

21
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,589
So if I type git log, look, this
tag is still here. If we don't

22
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:36,719
need it here, we can simply type
Git tag dash D for delete v 1.0.
