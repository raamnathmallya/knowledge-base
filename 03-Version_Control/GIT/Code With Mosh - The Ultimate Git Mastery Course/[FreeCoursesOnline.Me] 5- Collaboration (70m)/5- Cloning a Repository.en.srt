1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,079
So we have a GitHub repository
in the cloud. Now, every team

2
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:09,869
member should clone this
repository. That means they

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,509
should take a copy of this
repository and put it on their

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,689
machine. Locally, they will work
with that repository. And when

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,089
they're ready to share their
changes, they will push their

6
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,869
commits to this central
repository. Okay. So to clone

7
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,319
this repository, we go to the
code tab, here, we can see the

8
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:29,819
full URL of this repository.
Let's copy this, we go through

9
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:34,889
terminal and type git clone, and
paste the URL. When we execute

10
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:38,159
this command, Git is going to
create a directory by the same

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,309
name, the same name as our
repository. If you don't like

12
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,909
this name, you can always change
it. so here we can say, Mars

13
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,519
project, take a look. So git
clone our entire repository. So

14
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:53,879
all the commits in the central
repository also exist here on my

15
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,839
machine. Currently, we have only
a single commit. Now, let's go

16
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:05,309
to this directory, Mars project,
and run git log. So currently,

17
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,669
we have a single commit. Now
look at this pointers, we have

18
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:12,689
head pointing to master. And we
have these two pointers in red

19
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,379
origin slash master and origin
slash head. What are these?

20
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,919
Well, when we clone a
repository, get names the source

21
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:23,219
repository, in this case, the
one that we have on GitHub, get

22
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,819
names that origin. So origin is
a reference to that repository.

23
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,439
Origin slash master tells us
where is the master branch in

24
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,589
that repository, because now we
have multiple repositories, and

25
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:38,849
the history in each repository
can evolve independently. So

26
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,149
origin slash master tells us
where is the master branch in

27
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:45,329
our origin repository, that
technically this is called a

28
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,539
remote tracking branch. It's a
branch, but it's not a kind of

29
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:51,329
branch you are familiar with, so
we cannot check it out. We

30
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,989
cannot commit to it. So if you
type, git switch, origin slash

31
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:59,789
Master, we get an error. If you
type git branch, we can see we

32
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:04,289
only have a single branch, the
master branch. So origin slash

33
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:08,729
master is a remote tracking
branch. Similarly, origin slash

34
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,029
head tells us where's the head
pointer in our origin

35
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:14,939
repository. Here we have a
useful command, you should be

36
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,499
familiar with Git remote. This
shows the list of remote

37
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:22,739
repositories. A remote
repository is a repository that

38
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,829
is not on our machine more
accurately, it's not in the

39
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,159
current directory. So currently,
we have only a single remote

40
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,029
repository, that is our origin
repository. If we type Git

41
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:37,409
remote, dash V for verbose, we
can see more details about this

42
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:42,119
remote repository. So origin is
referencing this repository over

43
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:46,799
here github.com slash code with
Marsh slash Mars that get so

44
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,469
this is the URL that Git is
going to use when we talk to

45
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,639
this remote repository.
