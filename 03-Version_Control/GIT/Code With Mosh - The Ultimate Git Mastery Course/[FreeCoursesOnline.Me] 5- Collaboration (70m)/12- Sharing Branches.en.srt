1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,229
So far, we've been doing all the
work on master. Now let's talk

2
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:11,219
about working with branches. So
similar to tags, our branches

3
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:14,849
are private or local by default.
So if you want to collaborate

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,969
with other team members using a
branch, we have to explicitly

5
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,329
push that branch the same way we
push tags. So I'm going to

6
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,259
create a new branch called
feature slash Change Password.

7
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:29,789
Now, this is a private branch in
my local repository. It doesn't

8
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,779
exist on GitHub. So if we run
git push, we get this error

9
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:38,159
saying the current branch has no
upstream branch. This basically

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,119
means that this branch is not
linked to a branch in origin. So

11
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,549
Git is suggesting to run this
command to solve the problem.

12
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:50,489
But before doing so, let's run
git branch dash vv. So look,

13
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,179
here we can see our local and
remote tracking branches. So

14
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,749
Master, which is a local branch
is linked to origin slash

15
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:01,589
master. But features change
password is not linked to a

16
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:04,829
remote tracking branch. Now to
see all the remote tracking

17
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,849
branches, we can type git branch
dash R. So currently, we have

18
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:12,089
only these two pointers, origin
slash head and origin slash

19
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:16,049
master. So to link this private
branch to a branch in origin,

20
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,349
the first time you want to push
it, you have to type git push,

21
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,819
dash you that is the short form
offset upstream and then we type

22
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,429
the remote in this case, origin,
followed by the name of the

23
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:33,029
branch, so feature slash Change
Password. Alright, beautiful,

24
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,539
our branches pushed, we can
verify on GitHub. So let's

25
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:41,189
refresh this page. Now we have
two branches. And here's our new

26
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,879
branch. The back to the
terminal. If I type git branch

27
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,619
dash vv, you can see that this
local branch is now linked with

28
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,529
this remote tracking branch
origin slash feature slash

29
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,519
Change Password. Also, we can
look at all the remote tracking

30
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,719
branches. So now we have a new
remote tracking branch. Perfect.

31
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,869
Now we can start working with
this branch the same way we work

32
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,079
with Master so we can make new
commits here and then push them

33
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,229
to origin. At some point when
you're done, we want to remove

34
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,519
this rat. To do that we type git
push that previously we use

35
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,329
Dashiell and now we're going to
use dash D for delete. Then we

36
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:21,809
type the remote followed by the
branch name, feature slash

37
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,509
Change Password. Now this branch
is deleted from origin, we can

38
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,259
verify it right here. So
refresh, we only have a single

39
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,909
branch. Now let's type git
branch dash our our remote

40
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,759
tracking branch has gone
beautiful. But what if we type

41
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,829
git branch dash vv, we still
have this local branch that is

42
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,359
linked to origin slash feature
slash Change Password. But right

43
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,019
in front of this remote tracking
branch we have gone. So even

44
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,139
though we removed this branch
from origin, our local branch is

45
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,279
still there. So if we type git
branch, we can see it's right

46
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,039
here. And we're currently on
this branch so we cannot delete

47
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,419
it. So we have to switch to
master and then type git branch

48
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,119
dash D feature slash Change
Password. So this is how we can

49
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:15,509
create and delete branches in a
remote repository. Next, I'm

50
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:18,329
going to walk you through a real
collaboration scenario using

51
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:18,899
branches
