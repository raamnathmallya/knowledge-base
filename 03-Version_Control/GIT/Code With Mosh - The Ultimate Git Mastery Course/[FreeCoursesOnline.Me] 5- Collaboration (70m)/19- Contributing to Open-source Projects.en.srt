1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,450
So we have covered all the
essential collaboration tools.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,230
Now let's see how we can work on
an open source project. For this

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,590
demo, I'm looking at this
repository with Vidly suite 5in

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,500
my personal GitHub account, le
's say you want to contribute

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,410
to this repository, perhaps
ou found a bug, or want

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,850
to implement a new feature. So
ou come to the issues tab, you

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,640
an create a new issue and descr
be the bug or the feature you w

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,850
nt to implement. Or you can p
ck one of the existing issu

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,780
s. Currently, there are 79, o
en issues here. Here's the probl

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,260
m, you don't have push access
to this repository, only I can p

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,970
sh to it. So what you need to do
is you go to the top and fork t

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,810
is repository. When you fork t
is repository, GitHub will tak

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,590
a complete copy of this reposit
ry and put it in your account,

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,080
ou have full control over t
at repository, you can create

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,380
ew branches, new tags, you can p
sh your stuff, you can do anyth

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,700
ng you want, right. So current
y, I'm logged in using my ot

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,310
er GitHub account, that is C
de with Mosh account, I'm going

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,850
o fork this repository that is
n my personal account, take

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,150
a loo

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,570
It's gonna take a few seconds.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,330
All right, look, we have a copy
of this repository in my code

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,510
with Mosh account, which is
orked from my personal account.

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,840
o this is my repository and
itHub. Now, I'm going to clone

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,470
t on my local machine and start
orking on it. So let's go to

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,610
ode, grab the URL, and then
lone this repository. Good. So

26
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,150
ow let's go to this directory.
'm going to start a new branch,

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,940
it switch dash c, we can call
t buck fix. Now on this branch,

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,770
'm going to make a commit. So
et's echo hello to our README

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,130
ile, and then make a commit and
ay update README. Good. Now I'm

30
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,810
oing to push this branch to my
itHub repository. So git push

31
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,770
ashiell the first I'm going to
ush this branch origin, which

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,710
epresents my fork to
epository, and then the name of

33
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,860
he branch. That is bug fix.
ow, back on GitHub, my bug fix

34
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,190
ranch has recent push us. So
hen I'm done with this branch,

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,530
can start a pull request. Now
ook over here, we're trying to

36
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,670
ompare that bug fix branch and
his forked repository in my

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,200
ode much account. But comparing
hat with Master of this base

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,620
epository that is in my
ersonal account. So starting a

39
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,500
ull request is exactly like
efore, the only difference that

40
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,200
e have here is that we have two
epositories, the base

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,130
epository, which is the main or
he official repository, and my

42
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,100
ork repository. Now, we should
ive this Pull Request a

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,360
escriptive title. So we can say
ug fix, and change password

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,440
or, of course, we can leave
ore details, and then create

45
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,610
he pull request. Now the
aintainer of this repository,

46
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,490
n this case, myself is going to
et notified. So I'm going to

47
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,100
ome back here and have a
onversation with the person who

48
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,340
uggested these changes. So just
ike before, we can have a

49
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,640
onversation and the maintainer
an request changes, and the

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
ontributor can push new
ommits. At some point, when the

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,940
aintainer is happy, they can
ome over here and merge this

52
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,090
ull request. Here's the
nteresting part. Currently, I'm

53
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,320
ogged in using my code wash
ccount. So I'm a contributor to

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,090
his repository. Now look, I
annot merge and close this pull

55
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,590
equest, only the maintainer can
o this. So on this other

56
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,250
rowser window, I'm logged in
sing my personal account. And

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,200
ook, we have four pull
equests. And here's the last

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,620
ne that I just created using my
ther account. So I can look at

59
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,390
his pull request. Go through
hanges with the contributor. At

60
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,390
ome point when I'm happy, I can
erge and close this pull

61
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:51,930
equest.
