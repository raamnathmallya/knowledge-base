1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,720
So here's the current situation.
On the left side, we have our

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,840
local repository. And on the
right side, we have our remote

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,780
repository, which is the
repository hosted by GitHub in

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,750
the cloud. Now, one thing to
understand here is that our

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,540
local repository is not
connected to the remote

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,930
repository. So if you have a new
commit in our remote repository,

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,500
our local repository will not be
aware of that. Here, we have to

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,800
use the fetch command to
download this new commit. So Git

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,350
is going to download this new
command. And then we'll origin

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,160
slash master forward. So as I
told you before, origin slash

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,370
master is a remote tracking
branch, and tells us where's the

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,850
master branch and origin. In
this case, it's pointing to B.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,060
Even though we downloaded this
new commit, our working

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,420
directory is none updated.
Because currently master is

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,270
pointing to a, that is the
previous commit the previous

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,000
snapshot. So we don't have those
changes in our working

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,540
directory. Now, how can we bring
those changes here? Well, we

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,820
have two branches, doesn't
matter that one of them is a

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,000
remote tracking branch. And to
bring those changes into Master,

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,550
we have to merge the other
branch into master.

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,420
So

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,020
we switch to the master branch
and type Git merge, origin slash

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,710
master. Now in this case, our
branches haven't diverged. And

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,580
we have a direct linear path
from origin slash master to

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,630
master. So we're going to have a
fast forward merge. In contrast,

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,360
if our branches had diverged,
potentially, we could have a

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,330
conflict. So we'll have to
resolve the conflict just like

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,620
before, let's see this in
action. Here on GitHub, we can

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,610
go to Add File and create a new
file or upload files, we can

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,970
also edit existing files. So in
this demo, I'm going to edit our

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,970
README file and create a new
commit directly on this

32
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,640
repository. So let's click on
README file, and then we click

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,430
on this pencil icon. Now let's
add a new line of code, we can

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,850
preview our changes. So we're
adding this new line that is

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,720
indicated by green. And over
here, we can specify our commit

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,070
message. So by default, GitHub
is suggesting update README, we

37
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,220
can leave it as is, optionally,
we can add some description here

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,670
as well. Here, we have two
options, we can commit directly

39
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,480
to master. Or we can create a
new branch and start a pull

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,780
request. I'll talk about the
second option in the future. So

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,960
let's commit this directly on
master. And now, back on the

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,720
homepage of our repository. So
you can see we have two

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,810
commands, let's have a quick
look. Here's our new commit

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,800
update README. Now back in the
terminal, we don't have this new

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,280
commit in our local repository,
let me show you. So we type git

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,030
log. And, look, we only have
this commit over here, that is

47
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,910
the initial commit. So to
download new commands, we have

48
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,530
to type Git fetch. And then we
specify the remote, in this case

49
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,940
origin. and optionally, we can
specify a branch. So if you want

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,520
to download the commits on a
particular branch, we can type

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,490
the branch name here, if we
leave it out, we're going to

52
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,360
download all the comments in
that remote repository. If you

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,570
drop origin, get assumes that we
want to fetch the commits from

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,590
origin. So let's go with that.
Alright, we fetch the new

55
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,250
commit. Let's verify it. So
let's look at the log one more

56
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,130
time. See, our remote tracking
branch has moved forward. So now

57
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,640
we have this new command. But
this commit is not on our master

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,570
branch. So master is behind by
one commit. There is another

59
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,030
useful command you should be
familiar with. That is git

60
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,970
branch dash vv. It shows how our
local and remote tracking

61
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,770
branches are diverging. So our
master branch is linked to this

62
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,600
branch origin slash Master, and
it's behind by one commit. So

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,810
now we have to do a merge. So
we're currently on Master, we

64
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,970
type Git merge origin slash
Master, because our branches

65
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,210
haven't diverged. And we have a
direct linear path from this

66
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,970
target branch into Master, we're
going to have a fast forward

67
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,470
merge, take a look. There you
go. Fast forward. Now let's look

68
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:11,130
at the log one more time. So git
log. So Master, and origin slash

69
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,820
master are pointing to the same
commit. We can also verify this

70
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,520
using git branch dash vv. So we
no longer have that message, one

71
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,730
commit behind. Now we can look
at the content of a readme file

72
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,570
using the cat command. So cat
README, and

73
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,299
here's the new line that I added
on GitHub.

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,730
So this change is now in our
working directory.
