1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,020
So to bring the changes in a
remote repository into our local

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,290
repository, most of the time, we
have to do a fetch, followed by

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,500
a merge. So we have a command
that combines the two, it's the

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,860
pull command, let's see how it
works. So let's say our local

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,860
and remote repositories are in
the same state, we have a single

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,590
commit in both these
repositories. Now our

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,770
repositories are going to evolve
in different ways. So in our

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,580
local repository, we're going to
add this new commit beam. And in

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,070
our remote repository, we're
going to add this other commit,

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,210
see, so when we run git pull,
Git is going to download C and

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,480
put it into our local
repository, not that origin

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,960
slash master is pointing to see.
So now our branches have

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,140
diverged. In this case, Git is
going to perform a three way

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,620
merge to bring the remote
changes into our master branch.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,620
Now, some people don't like
these merge commits, because

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,410
they pollute the history. So
alternatively, we can use

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,590
rebasing here, so I'm going to
undo the merge commit, we're in

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,340
the same state as before, if we
use the rebase option, Git is

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,640
going to rebase, our master
branch on top of origin slash

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,020
master. So what is the base of
our master branch, it's a when

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,810
we use the rebase option, and
Git is going to change the base

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,310
of our master from A to C. So
essentially, it's replaying our

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,270
local changes and on top of
changes made by others, with

24
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,630
this will end up with simple
nonlinear history. Now, which

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,510
approach is better? Well, it
depends who you ask. This has

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,630
been a discussion going for
years. Some people love rebasing

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,500
others prefer merge commits. Now
let's see this in action. So

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,260
once again, let's create another
commit on GitHub, I'm going to

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:45,510
edit the readme file and add yet
another line of code. Let's make

30
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:53,520
a commit. Good. So back into
terminal, I'm also going to make

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,660
a commit in master. So our local
and remote branches diverged. So

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:05,610
we can add a new file, file one,
then added committed at file on

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,830
good, let's have a quick look at
our log. So git log. So our

34
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,670
master branch is ahead of origin
slash master by one commit. But

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,340
at this point, we are not aware
of the commit we made on GitHub.

36
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,230
So if we run git pull, Git is
going to download the new commit

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,620
in our GitHub repository, and
then perform a three way merge

38
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:33,060
to bring those changes into our
master, take a look. So here's

39
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,340
the default message for our
merge commit, we're going to

40
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,910
accept it.

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,290
Now back in the terminal. Let's
look at the log one more time.

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,270
There you go. Here's our merge
commit that combines the changes

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,890
in origin slash master and
master. So we ended up with

44
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,640
nonlinear history. Here, we can
use rebasing to create linear

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,850
history. But before doing so,
I'm going to undo it this last

46
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,630
merge commit, so we end up in
the previous state. So we type

47
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,410
Git reset, dash dash heart, head
till the one. Okay, let's look

48
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,950
at our log. So we're in the
previous state before the merge

49
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,190
commit, our branches have
diverse. Now we can run git pull

50
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,240
rebase to replay our local
changes, in this case, adding

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,140
this file on top of the changes
in origin slash master. So we

52
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,650
type Git pull dash dash rebase.
Alright, now, let's look at the

53
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,700
log one more time. Now we have
simple linear history. This

54
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,360
commit that we have in master
for adding file one is added on

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,990
top of the last commit we made
on GitHub. Now look over here,

56
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,930
my terminal window is saying
that I have one commit to push

57
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,180
to origin. I'll show you how to
do that, next.
